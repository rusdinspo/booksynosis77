<h1>BOOK SYNOPSIS & REVIEW</H1><br><a href='https://ebukpdfmobikindele.blogspot.com/'>Source|Download|Full Content</a><h2>Infectious Diseases of Humans: Dynamics and Control</h2><p>This book deals with infectious diseases -- viral, bacterial, protozoan and helminth -- in terms of the dynamics of their interaction with host populations. The book combines mathematical models with extensive use of epidemiological and other data. This analytic framework is highly useful for the evaluation of public health strategies aimed at controlling or eradicating particular infections. Such a framework is increasingly important in light of the widespread concern for primary health care programs aimed at such diseases as measles, malaria, river blindness, sleeping sickness, and schistosomiasis, and the advent of AIDS/HIV and other emerging viruses. Throughout the book, the mathematics is used as a tool for thinking clearly about fundamental and applied problems having to do with infectious diseases. The book is divided into two parts, one dealing with microparasites (viruses, bacteria and protozoans) and the other with macroparasites (helminths and parasitic arthropods). Each part begins with simple models, developed in a biologically intuitive way, and then goes on to develop more complicated and realistic models as tools for public health planning. The book synthesizes previous work in this rapidly growing field (much of which is scattered between the ecological and the medical literature) with a good deal of new material.<br></p><p>Roy M.

Supported by recent peer reviewed academic research, this book discusses topics in the context in which they occur in the M&amp;A process.</p> <p>It is <i>current</i> providing many of the most recent notable deals, precedent-setting judicial decisions, government policies and regulations, and trends affecting M&amp;As, as well as takeover strategies and tactics. For example, the book discusses the implications of the US Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017, data protection laws, and digital currencies for M&amp;As. Today's policies, politics, and economics are reflected in the book's nearly 40 case studies, 90% of which involve deals either announced or completed during the last several years. These cases represent friendly, hostile, highly leveraged, and cross-border transactions in ten different industries, involving public and private firms as well as firms experiencing financial distress. </p> <p>It is <i>comprehensive</i> in that all aspects of M&amp;As and restructuring are explored in detail. Part I provides an overview of M&amp;As, a discussion of key regulations, and common M&amp;A strategies and tactics. Part II discusses how managers may choose a business strategy from available options; Part III introduces valuation methods and basic financial modeling techniques. The negotiating process, how deal structuring and financing are inextricably linked, how consensus is reached during the bargaining process, and the role of financial models in closing the deal are described in Part IV. Finally, Part V addresses strategic growth options as alternatives to domestic M&amp;As, including corporate restructuring programs ranging from bankruptcy reorganization to business alliances to cross-border M&amp;As. </p> <p>It is <i>cutting edge</i> in that conclusions and insights are anchored by the most recent academic research, with references to more than 270 empirical studies published in leading peer-reviewed journals just since 2017. Often questioning conventional wisdom, the analyses and results of these academic studies can change the way we view this subject matter. </p> <p>An online instructors' manual accompanying the text contains PowerPoint presentations (including instructor commentary on most slides) for each chapter, suggested learning objectives, recommended ways to teach the materials, detailed syllabi for both undergraduate- and graduate-level classes, and an exhaustive test bank. The test bank consists of more than 1,600 test questions and answers (including true/false, multiple choice, short essay questions, case studies, and computational problems), as well as solutions to end-of-chapter questions and case studies. Excel spreadsheets illustrate how models facilitate valuation and deal negotiation and financing.</p>Donald M.

Emmanuel Levinas, Maurice Merleau-Ponty, Edmund Husserl, Didier Franck, Martin Heidegger, Francoise Dastur, and Jean-Louis Chr�tien are discussed, as are Ren� Descartes, Diderot, Maine de Biran, F�lix Ravaisson, Immanuel Kant, Sigmund Freud, and others. The scope of Derrida's deliberations makes this book a virtual encyclopedia of the philosophy of touch (and the body).</p> <p>Derrida gives special consideration to the thinking of touch in Christianity and, in discussing Jean-Luc Nancy's essay "Deconstruction of Christianity," devotes a section of the book to the sense of touch in the Gospels. Another section concentrates on "the flesh," as treated by Merleau-Ponty and others in his wake. Derrida's critique of intuitionism, notably in the phenomenological tradition, is one of the guiding threads of the book.</p> <p><i>On Touching</i> includes a wealth of notes that provide an extremely useful bibliographical resource. Personal and detached all at once, this book, one of the first published in English translation after Jacques Derrida's death, serves as a useful and poignant retrospective on the work of the philosopher. A tribute by Jean-Luc Nancy, written a day after Jacques Derrida's death, is an added feature.</p></p><p>&#x201c;The translation of On Touching: Jean-Luc Nancy is a momentous event, for this is one of the greatest, most important works in Derrida&#x2019;s immense oeuvre. It undertakes nothing less than a deconstruction of the phenomenological principle of principles, intuitionism, and the touchstone experience called touching. In a circulation through the history of philosophy since Aristotle up to the work of his contemporary and beloved friend Jean-Luc Nancy, the epochal thinker of touch, this book comes from and goes to the very heart of Derrida&#x2019;s thought.&#x201d;<br>&#x2014;Peggy Kamuf,<br>University of Southern CaliforniaJacques Derrida (1930-2004) was Director of Studies at the Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales and Professor of Humanities at the University of California, Irvine.

Or do complex systems of accountability and control damage trust? Onora O&#39;Neill challenges current approaches, investigates sources of deception in our society and re-examines questions of press freedom. This year&#39;s Reith Lectures present a philosopher&#39;s view of trust and deception and ask whether and how trust can be restored in modern democracy.</p><p>Onora O&#39;Neill&#39;s timely new work highlights a great paradox: in order to inspire trust, we, the public, require more accountability, more transparency. But the more we learn about our financial institutions, our politicians, our medical practitioners, our clergy, and many other people who have a direct effect on our lives, the less willing we are to trust them. Their word is doubted, their motives questioned. Whether real or perceived, this crisis of trust has a debilitating impact on society and democracy. Can trust be restored by making people and institutions more accountable in a modern democracy? Or do complex systems of accountability and control damage trust?

Written by an in-service teacher, this publication contains strategies and lessons that have been tested and refined in the &#39;real world&#39; of a public school music classroom. Organized according to the nine National Standards for Music Education, each chapter presents tips and lessons for helping middle school students meet high standards in their understanding of music. Ideas include a Music Critics Unit, composition projects, rhythm games, and tips for encouraging students to sing with enthusiasm. Also contained in the book is a rationale for the inclusion of general music courses in the middle school program, and tips for working with young adolescents. A list of suggested resources is included. For middle school general music teachers looking to create a program that is viable, participatory, and motivating to adolescents, this publication is a useful tool.</p><p>Elizabeth Ann McAnally is a middle school general music teacher and choral director at Woodrow Wilson Middle School in Philadelphia, where she is very busy, but never bored! In addition to teaching, she writes and speaks on the topics of middle school general music and urban music education.Where was this book when I first taught sixth-grade general music? Elizabeth Ann McAnally has written an excellent book, organized around the National Standards for Music Education, that every middle school&#x2015;and upper elementary!&#x2015;general music teacher will want to read and use. This is an easy read and is chock-a-block full of specific teaching strategies and games that are highly appealing, age-appropriate, and musical for today's middle schoolers. (Diane Persellin, editor, General Music Today; professor of music education, Trinity University)<br><br>This book is an excellent resource for teaching general/vocal music to students in the middle years. It is based on real-world experiences from a veteran teacher who demonstrates compassion for meeting the challenges of teaching adolescents in an urban environment. Highly recommended! (Viginia Lam, content specialist for music education, School District of Philadelphia)<br><br><i>Middle School General Music</i> is firmly grounded in the belief that <i>learning to do</i> music results in <i>learning about</i> music. Instead of the far too-common drudgery of stereotypical worksheet-and-lecture music appreciation classes, McAnally offers activity-based music activities designed with the needs and interests of young adolescents in mind. These activities will apply equally well in school music situations with a variety of resources and budgets. McAnally's affinity for the middle school general music student shines through in this practical, approachable book. (Patrick K. Freer, associate professor of choral music education, Georgia State University)</p><h2>The Crisis of Imprisonment: Protest, Politics, and the Making of the American Penal State, 1776&#x2013;1941 (Cambridge Historical Studies in American Law and Society)</h2><p>In the Age of Jackson, private enterprise set up shop in the American penal system. Working hand in glove with state government, contractors in both the North and the South would go on to put more than half a million imprisoned men, women, and youth to hard, sweated toil for private gain by 1900. Held captive, stripped of their rights, and subject to lash and paddle, convict laborers churned out vast quantities of goods and revenue, in some years generating the equivalent of more than $30 billion worth of work. By the 1880s, however, a growing mass of Americans came to regard the prison labor system as immoral and unbefitting of a free republic: it fostered torture and other abuses, degraded free citizen-workers, corrupted government and the legal system, and stifled the supposedly ethical purposes of punishment. The Crisis of Imprisonment tells the remarkable story of this controversial system of penal servitude:-how it came into being, how it worked, how the popular campaigns for its abolition were ultimately victorious, and how it shaped and continues to haunt the American penal system. The author takes the reader into the morally vital world of nineteenth-century artisans, industrial workers, farmers, clergy, convicts, machine politicians, and labor leaders and shows how prisons became a lightning rod in a determined defense of republican and Christian values against the encroachments of an unbridled market capitalism. She explores the vexing ethical questions that prisons posed then and remain exigent today: What are the limits of state power over the minds, bodies, and souls of citizens and others-is torture permissible under certain circumstances? What, if anything, makes the state morally fit to deprive a person of life or liberty? Are prisoners slaves and, if so, by what right? Should prisoners work? Is the prison a morally defensible institution? The eventual abolition of prison labor contracting plunged the prisons into deep fiscal and ideological crisis. The second half of the book offers a sweeping reinterpretation of Progressive Era prison reform as, above all, a response to this crisis. It concludes with an exploration of the long-range impact of both penal servitude and the anti-prison labor movement on the modern American penal system.</p><p>America&#39;s prison-based system of punishment has not always enjoyed the widespread political and moral legitimacy it has today. Unearthing fresh evidence from prison and state archives, McLennan shows how, in each of three distinct periods of crisis, widespread dissent culminated in the dismantling of old systems of imprisonment.Rebecca M. McLennan is Associate Professor of History at the University of California, Berkeley. She has also taught at Columbia University and Harvard University. She completed her graduate studies in American History at Columbia University, where her doctoral thesis on the making of the progressive penal state was awarded the Bancroft Prize for best dissertation in historical studies in 1999.</p><h2>Introduction to Environmental Engineering</h2><p><b> </b>In <i>Introduction to Environmental Engineering, First Edition, </i>authors Richard Mines and Laura Lackey explain complicated environmental systems in easy-to-understand terms, providing numerous examples and an emphasis on current environmental issues such as global warming, the failing infrastructure within the United States, risk assessment, and hazardous waste remediation. <b>KEY TOPICS</b>: Environmental Engineering as a Profession; Introduction to Environmental Engineering Calculations: Dimensions, Units, and Conversions; Essential Chemical Concepts; Biological and Ecological Concepts; Risk Assessment; Design and Modeling of Environmental Systems; Sustainability and Green Development; Water Quality and Pollution; Water Treatment; Domestic Wastewater Treatment; Air Pollution; Fundamentals of Hazardous Waste Site Remediation; Introduction to Solid Waste Management. <b>MARKET</b>: Appropriate for engineers interested in a comprehensive and up-to-date introduction to environmental engineering.</p><p></p><h2>Men Like That: A Southern Queer History</h2><p><p>We don't usually associate thriving queer culture with rural America, but John Howard's unparalleled history of queer life in the South persuasively debunks the myth that same-sex desires can't find expression outside the big city. In fact, this book shows that the nominally conservative institutions of small-town life&#x2014;home, church, school, and workplace&#x2014;were the very sites where queer sexuality flourished. As Howard recounts the life stories of the ordinary and the famous, often in their own words, he also locates the material traces of queer sexuality in the landscape: from the farmhouse to the church social, from sports facilities to roadside rest areas.<br> <br> Spanning four decades, <i>Men Like That</i> complicates traditional notions of a post-WWII conformist wave in America. Howard argues that the 1950s, for example, were a period of vibrant queer networking in Mississippi, while during the so-called "free love" 1960s homosexuals faced aggressive oppression. When queer sex was linked to racial agitation and when key civil rights leaders were implicated in homosexual acts, authorities cracked down and literally ran the accused out of town.<br> <br> In addition to firsthand accounts, <i>Men Like That</i> finds representations of homosexuality in regional pulp fiction and artwork, as well as in the number one pop song about a suicidal youth who jumps off the Tallahatchie Bridge. And Howard offers frank, unprecedented assessments of outrageous public scandals: a conservative U.S. congressman caught in the act in Washington, and a white candidate for governor accused of patronizing black transgender sex workers.<br> <br> The first book-length history of the queer South, <i>Men Like That</i> completely reorients our presuppositions about gay identity and about the dynamics of country life.<br> <br> "Men Like That goes a long way towards redressing the urban bias in American lesbian and gay-history writing. . . . Howard's rigorous scholarship, which is based both on oral history and traditional historical documents . . . is enhanced by a disarmingly personal touch. . . . His insights into queerness and the mentality of the American South should be of great interest both to the professional gay historian and the general reader."&#x2014;Madeleine Minson, <i>Times Higher Education Supplement</i><br> <br> "Howard creates a history remarkable in its complexity yet intimate in its portraiture. At long last an intimate and full vision of queer lives in America that did not unfold in San Francisco's discos."&#x2014;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br> <br> "In this groundbreaking and engrossing analysis of gay male life in postwar Mississippi, Howard . . . boldly demonstrates that gay culture and sex not only existed but flourished in small towns."&#x2014;<i>Publishers Weekly,</i> starred review<br> <br></p></p><p>"[O]ne of the most important books yet written about gay life in the U.S."-<i>Choice</i><br><br>This unparalleled history of queer life in the South persuasively challenges the commonly accepted idea that same-sex desire cannot find expression outside the big city.

It offers a basic review of units and dimensions, material balances, and problem-solving tips, and then emphasizes those chemical and physical transport processes that have applications in the development of artificial and bioartificial organs, controlled drug delivery systems, and tissue engineering. The book also includes a discussion of thermodynamic concepts and covers topics such as body fluids, osmosis and membrane filtration, physical and flow properties of blood, solute and oxygen transport, and pharmacokinetic analysis. It concludes with the application of these principles to extracorporeal devices as well as tissue engineering and bioartificial organs.</p> <p></p> <p>Designed for the beginning student, <strong>Basic Transport Phenomena in Biomedical Engineering, Third Edition</strong> provides a quantitative understanding of the underlying physical, chemical, and biological phenomena involved. It offers mathematical models using the &#x2018;shell balance" or compartmental approaches, along with numerous examples and end-of-chapter problems based on these mathematical models and in many cases these models are compared with actual experimental data. Encouraging students to work examples with the mathematical software package of their choice, this text provides them the opportunity to explore various aspects of the solution on their own, or apply these techniques as starting points for the solution to their own problems.</p></p><p>Ronald L.

The author shows that, in terms of personnel, Jews were predominant throughout most of Viennese high culture, and so any attempts to dismiss the &#34;Jewish aspect&#34; of the intelligentsia are refuted. The book goes on to explain this &#34;Jewish aspect,&#34; dismissing any unitary, static model and adopting a historical approach that sees the &#34;Jewishness&#34; of Viennese modern culture as a result of the specific Jewish backgrounds of most of the leading cultural figures and their reactions to being Jewish.</p><p>This book studies the role played by Jews in the explosion of cultural innovation in Vienna at the turn of the century, which had its roots in the years following the Ausgleich of 1867 and its demise in the sweeping events of the 1930s."The solidity of his research, clarity and sophistication of his argumentation, and...felicity of his style combine to produce a book from which one can learn much and with pleasure."

Mansbridge's book is absolutely essential reading for anyone interested in democratic theory and practice.</p></p><p>Jane J. Mansbridge is professor of political science at Northwestern University. She is also on the faculty of the university&#39;s Center for Urban Affairs and Policy Research.ERA, Mansbridge believes, would have brought little direct change, but its influence on attitudes and on state legislation would have been substantial. Examining the ideologies and strategies of supporters and opponents, Mansbridge's thorough study views the campaign as a case study of voluntary organizations. She finds that both those who worked for and against ERA adopted strong interpretations of its effects both to justify the efforts of volunteers and to inspire them. The clear, perceptive text is amplified by tables and informative notes. Mansbridge's social scientist's analysis pairs well with the historical perspective of Mary Frances Berry's Why ERA Failed ( LJ 9/1/86). Recommended for public and academic libraries.

Greek physician Sextus Empiricus was immensely influential in the history of Western philosophy. The rediscovery and publication of this work in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries led directly to the skepticism of Montaigne, Gassendi, Bayle, Descartes, Berkeley, Hume, and others, and eventually to the preoccupation of modern philosophy with attempts to refute or otherwise combat philosophical skepticism. In recent years, however, it has become apparent that Pyrrhonism--the form of skepticism professed by Sextus--is in several important respects quite different from the modern forms of skepticism to which the writings of Sextus have given rise. Some of these differences are of particular philosophic interest because they seem to render the ancient form immune to many of the standard responses to skepticism that are made today.<br> In this book, which incorporates a new translation of the <em>Outlines</em> in their entirety, Benson Mates presents Pyrrhonism not as a mere historical curiosity, as has often been done, but as a philosophical position eminently worthy of serious philosophical consideration here and now. His thorough introduction sets the stage by explaining what Pyrrhonism is and what it is not, and by contrasting it in the relevant respects with modern skepticism. He gives particular attention to explicating a number of quasi-technical terms that occur frequently in the <em>Outlines</em> and have decisive bearing on the philosophical content. By rendering these terms more accurately and uniformly in his translation, he seeks to make the essential feautres of Sextus's Pyrrhonism more evident to the reader.<br> The latter part of the book consists of a detailed Commentary, which endeavors to discuss and explain the work, section by section, from a philosophical (as contrasted with a philological) point of view.<br></p><p>Benson Mates is at University of California, Berkeley (Emeritus).Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Greek</p><h2>Individuals: An Essay in Descriptive Metaphysics (University Paperbacks; Up)</h2><p>Since its publication in 1959, Individuals has become a modern philosophical classic.

Peter Strawson's most famous work, it sets out to describe nothing less than the basic subject matter of our thought. It contains Strawson's now famous argument for descriptive metaphysics and his repudiation of revisionary metaphysics, in which reality is something beyond the world of appearances.<br>Throughout, Individuals advances some highly influential and controversial ideas, such as 'non-solipsistic consciousness' and the concept of a person a 'primitive concept'</p><p>P.F Strawson taught at the University of Oxford from 1947, becoming Waynflete Professor of Metaphysical Philosophy in 1968.

Beginning with the notion of scalar fields, Professor Rojansky leads the student through vectors and vector fields, the laws of Ohm, Joule, Coulomb, and Faraday, static electricity, and continues all the way to Maxwell's equations for bodies at rest, and to examples of electromagnetic waves. A particularly useful feature of the book is the author's introduction and explanation of the necessary mathematics as he goes along, rather than presuming student understanding. Although an extensive background is not necessary, a general knowledge of physics and calculus is a prerequisite. <br>Throughout the book, the development of each topic is explicit and unhurried, an approach intended to avoid basic misconceptions that lead to major misunderstandings later on. Short exercises help the student test his grasp of the material, and the text is studded with diagrams and illustrations that supplement the content and elucidate many hard-to-visualize concepts. The book ends at a point where the use of Maxwell's equations in several important problems has been illustrated, and students are prepared to proceed to a variety of further topics. <br>Professor Rojansky brings many years of experience both as a teacher and a scientist (including ten years of advanced research at TRW Space Technologies Laboratories) to this lucid discussion of the fundamentals of electromagnetic fields and waves. His extensive pedagogical background enables him to communicate difficult concepts with great clarity.</p><p></p><h2>Confessions of a Dying Thief: Understanding Criminal Careers and Illegal Enterprise (New Lines in Criminology)</h2><p><p><strong>*Recipient of the American Society of Criminology's 2006 Michael J.

He had a criminal career that spanned fifty years, beginning in his mid-teens and ending with his death when he was in his mid-sixties. <em>Confessions of a Dying Thief</em> is an in-depth ethnographic study of Sam and his world based on continuous contact with him for many years, on multiple interviews with his network of associates in crime and business, and on a series of interviews with him shortly before he died.</p><p>The book updates and greatly expands the case study of Sam Goodman's fencing activity found in Steffensmeier's award-winning 1986 book <em>The Fence: In the Shadow of Two Worlds</em>. It combines Sam's colorful narrative accounts with substantive commentary by the authors to provide a more nuanced portrayal of criminal careers, illegal enterprise, and the broad landscape comprising the entity called "crime." To more fully understand pathways into and out of crime as well as the social organization of illegal enterprise, the authors propose an integrative learning-opportunity-commitment framework that combines differential association/social learning theory and an extended conceptualization of criminal opportunity with a three-fold theory of commitment to crime. This framework offers an integrated and more complete way of understanding mechanisms that underlie criminal offending and criminal careers. It also recognizes the complexity and scope of the criminal landscape and its embeddedness in the fabric of the larger society, including its criminal justice system.</p><p>Sam's illness and death are a sobering backdrop throughout the whole book. However, <em>Confessions</em> is not just a dying thief's intimate confessions.

As business ceaselessly revised its own practices, a new demographic of private bankers, insurance brokers, investors in securities, and start-up manufacturers, among many others, assumed center stage, displacing older elites and forms of property. Explaining how capital became an &#x201c;ism&#x201d; and how business became a political philosophy, <i>Capitalism Takes Command</i> brings the economy back into American social and cultural history.</p></p><p><p><b>Michael Zakim</b> is associate professor of history at Tel Aviv University.

Through a fresh examination of the judicial, legislative, and political aspects of the antitrust debates in the years from 1890-1916, Martin Sklar shows that the arguments did not arise simply because of competition versus combination, but because of the larger question of the proper relations between government and the market and between state and society.</p><p>An original examination of the antitrust debates (1890-1916) when regulatory minimalism and statist command were rejected in favor of a supportive government engaged in distributive as well as regulatory roles.Around the turn of the century American politics entered a period of profound change during which regulatory minimalism and statist command with respect to the economy were rejected in favor of positive government engaged in both regulatory and distributive roles. Through a fresh examination of the judicial, legislative, and political aspects of the antitrust debates in the year from 1890 to 1916, Martin J.

Joseph H. Kupfer argues that film fictions can be integral to moral reflection, and thus by examining the narrative and cinematic aspects of popular films, we can derive important moral truths about people and their behavior. Taking as his base a classical conception of virtue and vice, Kupfer offers an in-depth examination of Groundhog Day, The African Queen, Parenthood, Rob Roy, Fresh, Jaws, and Aliens in order to investigate the value of virtue within ever-widening social contexts.</p><p><b>Joseph Kupfer</b> is Professor of Philosophy at Iowa State University where he teaches aesthetics, medical ethics, family ethics, and philosophy of law.

In it Philip Mirowshki shows how what is conventionally thought to be &#34;history of technology&#34; can be integrated with the history of economic ideas. His analysis combines Cold War history with the history of the postwar economics profession in America and later elsewhere, revealing that the Pax Americana had much to do with the content of such abstruse and formal doctrines such as linear programming and game theory. He links the literature on &#34;cyborg science&#34; found in science studies to economics, an element missing in the literature to date. Mirowski further calls into question the idea that economics has been immune to postmodern currents found in the larger culture, arguing that neoclassical economics has surreptitiously participated in the desconstruction of the integral &#34;Self.&#34; Finally, he argues for a different style of economics, an alliance of computational and institutional themes, and challenges the widespread impression that there is nothing else besides American neoclassical economic theory left standing after the demise of Marxism. Philip Mirowski is Carl Koch Professor of Economics and the History and Philosophy of Science, University of Notre Dame. He teaches in both the economics and science studies communities and has written frequently for academic journals. He is also the author of More Heat than Light (Cambridge, 1992) and editor of Natural Images in Economics (Cambridge, 1994) and Science Bought and Sold (University of Chicago, 2001).</p><p>Machine Dreams recounts the story of how the computer came to transform the very content of American economics, and how the mathematician John von Neumann inadvertently became the most important thinker for the economics profession in the 20th century. The narrative crosses the two genres of the history of economic thought and World War II, arguing that the Second World War and the Cold War were central to the postwar rise of the neoclassical orthodoxy in America. The treatment concludes with reflections on the ways in which the computer will further transform economics in the 21st century.Philip Mirowski is Carl Koch Professor of Economics and the History and Philosophy of Science at the University of Notre Dame. His areas of specialization are in the history and philosophy of economics and the politics and economics of knowledge, with subsidiary areas in evolutionary computational economics, the economics of science and technological change, science studies and the history of the natural sciences.

How exactly did the nation, step by difficult step, take men to the Moon and back? <br><br>In <em>The Apollo Chronicles</em>, fifty years after the moon landing, author Brandon R. Brown, himself the son of an Apollo engineer, revisits the men and women who toiled behind the lights. He relays the defining twentieth-century project from its roots, bringing the engineers' work and personalities to bright life on the page. Set against the backdrop of a turbulent American decade, the narrative whisks audiences through tense deadlines and technical miracles, from President John F. Kennedy's 1961 challenge to NASA's 1969 lunar triumph, as engineers confronted wave after wave of previously unthinkable challenges. <br><br>Brown immerses readers in key physical hurdles--from building the world's most powerful rockets to keeping humans alive in the hostile void of space--using language free of acronyms and technical jargon.

Some addressed to a general audience, some to students and others to scientists, the essays all share a preoccupation with both the substance and the style of written scientific communication, and offer a unique view of everyday science or scientific practice with the intention of increased clarity for the reader. The author believes the tradition of bland and impersonal scientific writing over the past fifty years deprives scientists of powerful tools for enhancing their clarity and capacity to communicate complex ideas. A well recognized theoretical physicist and winner of the first Julius Edgar Lilienfeld prize of the American Physical Society, Mermin writes with wry humor and conveys complex ideas with startling simplicity.</p><p>Addressed to a general audience, these essays present the dilemma of communicating modern physics to physicists and nonphysicists by analyzing the substance and style of written scientific communication."...covers an astonishing broad range...Mermin is a natural philosopher par excellence..." Physics World<br><br>"A warm, human, and humane view of physics." American Mathematical Monthly<br><br>"From the outset, Mermin's writing is fluid, interesting and most of all, fun! Mermin's humorous talents are indicative of his creative abilities and deep understanding of his subject. At times one is tempted to reflect upon other skilled communicators, and flattering parallels with Feynman, for example, are not unreasonable." Physics in Canada<br><br>"David Mermin is one of those rather rare scientists who can write with cleverness and style....is delightful for browsing."

Examining the social and cultural significance of skin color in a broad range of societies and historical periods, this insightful collection looks at how skin color affects people's opportunities in Latin America, Asia, Africa, and North America. Is skin color bias distinct from racial bias? How does skin color preference relate to gender, given the association of lightness with desirability and beauty in women? The authors of this volume explore these and other questions as they take a closer look at the role Western-dominated culture and media have played in disseminating the ideal of light skin globally. With its comparative, international focus, this enlightening book will provide innovative insights and expand the dialogue around race and gender in the social sciences, ethnic studies, African American studies, and gender and women's studies.</p><p>Evelyn Nakano Glenn is Professor of Ethnic Studies and Gender and Women&#39;s Studies and Founding Director of the Center for Race and Gender at the University of California, Berkeley.

(Nina G. Jablonski)<br><br>"Skin color and race are often used synonymously in the US. From historical accounts of black beauty pageants to social meanings of color in Brazil to global marketing of skin lightening products, Nakano Glenn presents an array of research from different countries of the world to analyze the meanings and hierarchies of skin-color. The result is a very thought-provoking book that will reshape how scholars think about skin color and race in the contemporary world." (Bandana Purkayastha <i>University of Connecticut</i>)<br><br>"[T]his is an excellent collection with new findings, important ideas, and moving quotations and illustrations. I recommend it highly." (Jennifer L. Hochschild <i><i>Journal of American Ethnic History</i></i>)<br><br>"<i>Shades of Difference</i> is a distinguished collection that broadens the new area of colorism scholarship to include the national and international class dynamics of why skin color matters. Evelyn Nakano Glenn has brought together diverse authors to capture a range of identities shaped by the national and international politics and economics of skin color.

"Few books really deserve the clich� 'this should be read by every researcher in the field,'" writes Steven Pinker, author of <em>The Language Instinct</em>, "But Ray Jackendoff's <em>Foundations of Language</em> does."<br> <em>Foundations of Language</em> offers a radically new understanding of how language, the brain, and perception intermesh. The book renews the promise of early generative linguistics: that language can be a valuable entree into understanding the human mind and brain. The approach is remarkably interdisciplinary. Behind its innovations is Jackendoff's fundamental proposal that the creativity of language derives from multiple parallel generative systems linked by interface components. This shift in basic architecture makes possible a radical reconception of mental grammar and how it is learned. As a consequence, Jackendoff is able to reintegrate linguistics with philosophy of mind, cognitive and developmental psychology, evolutionary biology, neuroscience, and computational linguistics. Among the major topics treated are language processing, the relation of language to perception, the innateness of language, and the evolution of the language capacity, as well as more standard issues in linguistic theory such as the roles of syntax and the lexicon. In addition, Jackendoff offers a sophisticated theory of semantics that incorporates insights from philosophy of language, logic and formal semantics, lexical semantics of various stripes, cognitive grammar, psycholinguistic and neurolinguistic approaches, and the author's own conceptual semantics.<br> Here then is the most fundamental contribution to linguistic theory in over three decades.<br></p><p><br><strong>Ray Jackendoff</strong> is Professor of Linguistics at Brandeis University.

Taylor, <em>Studies in Language</em><p></p><br>"It's a rich mix, but one laid out in refreshingly plain language.... Provides challenging ideas and a fruitful combination of observation and analysis.... My advice is to read the book for the exceptional effort at synthesis that it is."--Merrill Garrett, <em>Science</em><p></p><br>"A sweeping survey of every major aspect of language and communication. ... He counters the belief that language stems from syntactic structure alone."--<em>Science News</em><p></p><br>"Jackendoff is certainly right in thinking that the question of why language has come to be as it is is one that linguists cannot permanently ignore... His breadth of knowledge and soundness of judgment, along with just the right amount of adventurousness, make for a book that deserves to be read and reread by anyone seriously interested in the state of the art of research on language."--<em>American Scientist</em><p></p><br>"Few books really deserve the cliche 'this should be read by every researcher in the field,' but Ray Jackendoff's <em>Foundations of Language</em> does. I think it is the most important book in the sciences of language to have appeared in many years. Jackendoff has long had a genius for seeing both he forest and the trees, and he puts his gift to good use here in a dazzling combination of theory-building and factual integration. The result is a compelling new view of language and its place in the natural world."--Steven Pinker, Professor of Psychology, MIT, and author of <em>The Language Instinct</em> and <em>Words</em> <em>and Rules</em><p></p><br>"A masterpiece....

To keep the exposition as smooth as possible, the economic analysis has been separated from the purely mathematical material &#x2014; permitting flexible use of the book as a text. Moreover, the chapters and reviews are designed as a self- contained system, wherein the reviews contain all the mathematics required for the chapters and the chapters illustrate the use of almost all the techniques set out in the reviews.

An extensive list of problems, ranging from routine exercises to research questions, is included. In each section, there are also exercises that contain material not explicitly discussed in the preceding text, so as to provide instructors with extra choices if they want to shift the emphasis of their course. Just as with the first two editions, the new edition walks the reader through the classic parts of combinatorial enumeration and graph theory, while also discussing some recent progress in the area: on the one hand, providing material that will help students learn the basic techniques, and on the other hand, showing that some questions at the forefront of research are comprehensible and accessible to the talented and hardworking undergraduate. The basic topics discussed are: the twelvefold way, cycles in permutations, the formula of inclusion and exclusion, the notion of graphs and trees, matchings, Eulerian and Hamiltonian cycles, and planar graphs. The selected advanced topics are: Ramsey theory, pattern avoidance, the probabilistic method, partially ordered sets, the theory of designs (new to this edition), enumeration under group action (new to this edition), generating functions of labeled and unlabeled structures and algorithms and complexity. As the goal of the book is to encourage students to learn more combinatorics, every effort has been made to provide them with a not only useful, but also enjoyable and engaging reading.</p><p>Miklos Bona received his PhD at Massachusetts Institute of Technology.

Walker identifies the major periods in the development of the American system of criminal justice, from the small institutions of the colonial period to the creation of the police, the prison, and the juvenile court in the nineteenth century and the search for professionalism in the twentieth century. He argues that the democratic tradition is responsible for the worst as well as the best in the history of criminal justice in the United States. Offering a challenging perspective on current controversies in the administration of criminal justice in light of historical origins, the author explores the evolving conflict between the advocates of crime control and the advocates of due process.<br>Now in its second edition, <em>Popular Justice</em> has been completely revised to include the most recent scholarship on crime and justice. Walker has updated his analysis of the history of American criminal justice and explores the tension between popular passions and the rule of law. He examines changing patterns in criminal activity, the institutional development of the system of criminal justice, and the major issues concerning the administration of justice. Timely and comprehensive, this text will be useful for courses in criminal justice, legal history, and criminology.<br></p><p>Samuel E.

The most influential argument in favor of freedom of navigation, trade, and fishing was that put forth by the Dutch theorist Hugo Grotius in his 1609 <i>Mare Liberum</i> (<b><i>The Free Sea</i></b>).<br><br><i><b>The Free Sea</b></i> was originally published in order to buttress Dutch claims of access to the lucrative markets of the East Indies. It had been composed as the twelfth chapter of a larger work, <i>De Jure Praedae</i> (<i>Commentary on the Law of Prize and Booty</i>), which Grotius had written to defend the Dutch East India Company&#x2019;s capture in 1603 of a rich Portuguese merchant ship in the Strait of Singapore.<br><br>Liberty Fund&#x2019;s new edition of <i><b>The Free Sea</b></i> is the only translation of Grotius&#x2019;s masterpiece undertaken in his own lifetime, left in manuscript by the English historian, Richard Hakluyt (1552 1616). It also contains William Welwod&#x2019;s critique of Grotius (reprinted for the first time since the seventeenth century) and Grotius&#x2019;s reply to Welwod. These documents provide an indispensable introduction to modern ideas of sovereignty and property as they emerged from the early-modern tradition of natural law.<br><p><b>Hugo Grotius</b> is one of the most important thinkers in the early-modern period.

The author uses a three-sided view to describe American engineering history: what great engineers actually did, the political and economic conditions within which they worked, and the influence that these designers and their achievements had on the nation. Billington explores the scientific basis of engineering through elementary formulas that also include the social issues of regulated loads, visually striking forms, acceptable risks, environmental issues, and the production of wealth.</p><h2>Roman Comedy: Five Plays by Plautus and Terence: Menaechmi, Rudens and Truculentus by Plautus; Adelphoe and Eunuchus by Terence (Focus Classical Library)</h2><p>This anthology contains English translations of five plays by two of the best practitioners of Roman comedy, Plautus and Terence.

Much more than a personal statement or occasional piece, it is a meditation on the state of poetry and art in general and a rigorous attempt to account for what poetry is, can, and must be after the Holocaust. This definitive historico-critical edition, available for the first time in English, presents not only the first drafts, but also a vast array of notes and preparatory work and a brief essay on Osip Mandelstam, all of which work to expand the field of reference of Celan's manifesto and reveal its true scope. Rich commentaries clarify Celan's notes to authors as diverse as Leibniz, Scheler, Kafka, Hofmannsthal, Husserl, Pascal, Val�ry, Heidegger, and others. Listen to an interview about Celan's <i>Meridian</i> with translator Pierre Joris on the radio program Cross Cultural Poetics, hosted by poet and professor Leonard Schwartz. The shows airs on KAOS 89.3FM Olympia, Washington and is archived online by The University of Pennsylvania's Pennsound.</p><p>Paul Celan (1920&#x2013;1970) remains the most important German-language poet of his time, His <i>oeuvre</i>&#x2015;11 volumes of poetry and a wide range of translations from eight languages of poets such as Shakespeare, Mandelstam, Val�ry, Rimbaud&#x2015;has received massive critical attention from major thinkers such as Hans-Georg Gadamer, Peter Szondi, Maurice Blanchot, Emmanuel Levinas, Jacques Derrida, and Philippe Lacoue-Labarthe."The Meridian speech is one of Paul Celan's key works. This meticulous, fascinating, and, finally, compelling edition begins by unlocking what seems to be the work's multifoliate nature. Ultimately, though, and with the help of Pierre Joris's eloquent translation, we discover that that under the many surfaces of this magisterial essay is an abyss of poetic thinking struggling to emerge into the light of our encounter." (Charles Bernstein <i>University of Pennsylvania</i>)<br><br>"It may seem quixotic to undertake a translation of all the notes and drafts leading up to <i>The Meridian</i>. However, with a poet of Celan's importance&#x2015;a poet not given to writing statements at all and whose collected prose amounts to some 50 pages&#x2015;just tracing the genesis of this major poetics statement would be worthwhile. But what we have here is more: it is a record of Celan's thinking. In other words, a treasure." (<i>Rosmarie Waldrop</i>)<br><br>"Over the last half century Paul Celan has emerged as the iconic poet of the postwar/post-Holocaust period&#x2015;for some of us the greatest German-language poet of the twentieth century as a whole. To those for whom he has served as a guide or beacon, his Meridian speech from 1960 remains his most telling testament to the powers and problematics of poetry and art. Now, in this remarkable work of scholarship, a still greater body of poetics and poesis comes to light. Inaugurated by Bernhard B�schenstein and Heino Schmull, and carried over into English by poet and translator Pierre Joris, Celan's celebration of the uncanny and transitory appears along with its several early versions and with a range of source materials that make up a poetic collage, an implicit epic, in their own right. Those who know how to read it will find sustenance here for years to come." (<i>Jerome Rothenberg</i>)<br><br>"This translation of a critical edition represents, as Joris himself notes, an epic work. In minute detail it traces the origins and evolution of Celan's Meridian speech for an Anglophone readership, thus making Celan's text as close as possible to an 'original' work in a language other than the one in which it was conceived and published. The volume represents an important step in 'naturalizing' Celan into the English language and (almost) opening his creative process and universe to non-native speakers of German." (Dagmar C. G.

Case studies illustrate how Jews have responded to such public misconceptions as the myth of the cloven foot and Jewish flat-footedness, the proposed link between the Jewish mind and hysteria, and the Victorians&#39; irrational connection between Jews and prostitutes. Gilman is especially concerned with the role of psychoanalysis in the construction of anti-Semitism, examining Freud&#39;s attitude towards his own Jewishness and its effect on his theories, as well as the supposed &#34;objectiveness&#34; of psychiatrists and social scientists.</p><p><strong></strong><strong><em>Sander Gilman</em></strong> is Goldwin Smith Professor of Humane Studies at Cornell University and Professor of the History of Psychiatry at Cornell Medical College.Circumcision engages Jewish males in a powerful paradox: while establishing their religious and cultural identity, it marks them as profoundly different in others' eyes. This difference manifests itself in perceptions of the Jewish male's habits and physiognomy. No matter what tongue he speaks, the Jew's language is always different and therefore suspect. Even Christ's final words--those of a Jew in Aramaic--must be "translated into Greek, Latin, German or English for the self-labeled Christian reader to understand." During the Austrian monarchy, Jews' feet were construed as weaker than other men's, disabling them from military service and signaling "their inability to be full citizens." In three central chapters, Gilman demonstrates how Freud's theory of creativity, which holds that artists sublimate unacceptable characteristics, universalizes his experience as a Viennese Jew compelled to "deny his essence" into a property of the human psyche. Applying the techniques of literary criticism to predominantly European myths, documents and artworks, Gilman ( Jewish Self-Hatred ) has written an intriguing interpretive history of the Jewish male body.

This compelling history of the British home front during the First World War offers an entirely new account of how British society understood and endured the war. Drawing on official archives, memoirs, diaries and letters, Adrian Gregory sheds new light on the public reaction to the war, examining the role of propaganda and rumour in fostering patriotism and hatred of the enemy. He shows the importance of the ethic of volunteerism and the rhetoric of sacrifice in debates over where the burdens of war should fall as well as the influence of religious ideas on wartime culture. As the war drew to a climax and tensions about the distribution of sacrifices threatened to tear society apart, he shows how victory and the processes of commemoration helped create a fiction of a society united in grief.</p><p>What was it that the British people believed they were fighting for in 1914-18?

In the past three decades, as advances in molecular biology have produced an avalanche of data, computational and mathematical techniques have also become necessary tools in the arsenal of biologists. But while quantitative approaches are now providing fundamental insights into biological systems, the college curriculum for biologists has not caught up, and most biology majors are never exposed to the computational and probabilistic mathematical approaches that dominate in biological research.<br> <br> With <i>Quantifying Life</i>, Dmitry A. Kondrashov offers an accessible introduction to the breadth of mathematical modeling used in biology today. Assuming only a foundation in high school mathematics, <i>Quantifying Life</i> takes an innovative computational approach to developing mathematical skills and intuition. Through lessons illustrated with copious examples, mathematical and programming exercises, literature discussion questions, and computational projects of various degrees of difficulty, students build and analyze models based on current research papers and learn to implement them in the R programming language. This interplay of mathematical ideas, systematically developed programming skills, and a broad selection of biological research topics makes <i>Quantifying Life</i> an invaluable guide for seasoned life scientists and the next generation of biologists alike.</p></p><p><b>Dmitry A. Kondrashov</b> is a senior lecturer in the Biological Sciences Collegiate Division at the University of Chicago, where he developed an introductory course in quantitative modeling for biology&#x2014;the origins of <i>Quantifying Life</i>. As an applied mathematician with research interests in protein structures and computational biology, he brings firsthand knowledge of the application of quantitative methods to biological problems and a passionate belief that experience with coding and mathematical skills opens new doors for young biologists.&#x201c;Taking a rare modeling approach, Kondrashov covers all of the mathematics and computation that biology students need, simultaneously introducing readers to programming in R (or any language really) and focusing on computational examples. And the writing is outstanding, the best I&#x2019;ve seen in a mathematics text. I love this book&#x2014;I will use pieces of it in every class I teach.&#x201d; (Sarah Hews, Hampshire College)<br><br>&#x201c;Very exciting, especially for life science students and those who teach biology. There is a growing need for more quantitative understanding among life scientists, and the concepts and tools provided in <i>Quantifying Life</i> are exactly the types of tools the field needs. It includes many of the standard tools of modeling but places an emphasis on stochastic processes and computation, two topics less common to many introductory modeling texts. It is unique in its inclusion of Bayesian analysis, Markov models, the use of linear algebra techniques in modeling, and a strong programming component, all designed for students with very little mathematical background. Further, the exercises place a much-needed importance on analysis of results and not just memorization of facts. The conversational style, use of real-world and modern data and examples, and hands-on approach mixing biological and mathematical background with programming in R are fantastic.&#x201d; (Hannah Callender, University of Portland)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Quantifying Life</i> . . . is an intriguing addition to the literature because of its hybrid nature: it combines some approaches to study data typically addressed in textbooks of biostatistics with others that are usually found in textbooks of mathematical biology. This approach is useful because it allows students to understand links between issues that are generally discussed in separate courses and to develop a more open mind in the numerical analysis of biological data. . . . This book deserves a space in the bookcase of people that want an introductory text to mathematical modelling in life sciences.&#x201d; (SimoneFattorini, University of L'Aquila, Italy <i>Biological Conservation</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;The book has seventeen short chapters, each of which is meant to represent a week&#x2019;s worth of material. Thus a big fraction of the book could be covered in a semester. Each chapter includes a bit of mathematics, necessarily quite elementary, some simple biological applications, and some computing exercises in R. The author is adamant that pencil-and-paper exercises are not enough; there has to be some computing. The students are not expected to know anything about R initially. The first exercises are extremely simple, and the complexity grows gradually as the students proceed through the book. By the end of the semester they should know a fair amount, which ought to serve them well in the future. . . . This looks to me like an improvement on the bio-calculus approach to educating biology students, and I hope this book proves to be a success.&#x201d; (David S. Watkins, Washington State University <i>SIAM Reviews</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;A wonderful and highly readable text that has the potential to have a great impact on the early training of biology students. . . . <i>Quantifying Life</i> is the best source for biology students to begin their study of quantitative modeling. The strengths of <i>Quantifying Life</i> are its size, choice of content, accessibility, price, and perhaps above all its approach to computing. I am also very excited about the use of the R language over other software or programming languages. . . . If you are a serious student of biology, then I strongly recommend to you to read <i>Quantifying Life</i>. I also believe that this book is a valuable resource for mathematicians and other quantitative scientists that find themselves working with biologists. It may prove very helpful in communicating with their collaborators in the life sciences.&#x201d; (Jason M.

My panache.' <br> <br> The first English translation of <em>Cyrano de Bergerac</em>, in 1898, introduced the word panache into the English language. This single word summed up Rostand's rejection of the social realism which dominated late nineteenth-century theatre. He wrote his `heroic comedy', unfashionably, in verse, and set it in the reign of Louis XIII and the Three Musketeers. Based on the life of a little known writer, Rostand's hero has become a figure of theatrical legend: Cyrano, with the nose of a clown and the soul of a poet, is by turns comic and sad, as reckless in love as in war, and never at a loss for words. Audiences immediately took him to their hearts, and since the triumphant opening night in December 1897 - at the height of the Dreyfus Affair - the play has never lost its appeal. The text is accompanied by notes and a full introduction which sets the play in its literary and historical context. Christopher Fry's acclaimed translation into `chiming couplets' represents the homage of one verse dramatist to another.<br><br><strong>About the Series: </strong>For over 100 years <strong>Oxford World's Classics</strong> has made available the broadest spectrum of literature from around the globe.

She, in turn, is in love with Christian, a handsome but inarticulate and slow-witted suitor. Asked for help by Christian in wooing Roxane, Cyrano pours out his heart in romantic dialogues&#x2014;delivered under cover of night and dense foliage&#x2014;and through ardent love letters written in the name of Christian.<br>Presented here in a rich blank verse translation by poet Louis Untermeyer, this beloved romantic comedy will be warmly received by theater buffs as well as students and teachers of drama and literature.</p>Translated by Anthony Burgess.</p><h2>TCP/IP Sockets in Java: Practical Guide for Programmers (The Morgan Kaufmann Series in Data Management Systems)</h2><p>The networking capabilities of the Java platform have been extended considerably since the first edition of the book. This new edition covers version 1.5-1.7, the most current iterations, as well as making the following improvements:<br><br>The API (application programming interface) reference sections in each chapter, which describe the relevant parts of each class, have been replaced with (i) a summary section that lists the classes and methods used in the code, and (ii) a "gotchas" section that mentions nonobvious or poorly-documented aspects of the objects. <br><br>In addition, the book covers several new classes and capabilities introduced in the last few revisions of the Java platform. New abstractions to be covered include NetworkInterface, InterfaceAddress, Inet4/6Address, SocketAddress/InetSocketAddress, Executor, and others; extended access to low-level network information; support for IPv6; more complete access to socket options; and scalable I/O. The example code is also modified to take advantage of new language features such as annotations, enumerations, as well as generics and implicit iterators where appropriate.<br><br>Most Internet applications use sockets to implement network communication protocols. This book's focused, tutorial-based approach helps the reader master the tasks and techniques essential to virtually all client-server projects using sockets in Java. Chapter 1 provides a general overview of networking concepts to allow readers to synchronize the concepts with terminology. Chapter 2 introduces the mechanics of simple clients and servers. Chapter 3 covers basic message construction and parsing. Chapter 4 then deals with techniques used to build more robust clients and servers. Chapter 5 (NEW) introduces the scalable interface facilities which were introduced in Java 1.5, including the buffer and channel abstractions. Chapter 6 discusses the relationship between the programming constructs and the underlying protocol implementations in more detail. Programming concepts are introduced through simple program examples accompanied by line-by-line code commentary that describes the purpose of every part of the program. No other resource presents so concisely or so effectively the material necessary to get up and running with Java sockets programming.<ul><li>Focused, tutorial-based instruction in key sockets programming techniques allows reader to quickly come up to speed on Java applications.</li><li>Concise and up-to-date coverage of the most recent platform (1.7) for Java applications in networking technology.</li></ul></p><p><p><b>Kenneth L.

While I don't see the need to update most books every time there's a minor update, this book is definitely overdue for a revision.<br><br>"I think the book is especially appropriate for mature practitioners and students, who need an easily-accessible and to-the-point overview of the Java networking APIs. To me, one of the strongest points of the book is that it's concise enough to serve as a quick guide and reference to key ?gotchas.? Thus, I think the structure of the book serves audiences who are already good network programmers, or who need a good Java reference, quite well." <br><br>Robert Brunner, Research Programmer, National Center for Supercomputing Applications (NCSA)--<br>"I think the book does a good job of hitting this market. It is not suited to be a main textbook for a class, and it does not try to do that, But it does do a nice job of succinctly hitting the major points, providing nice examples, as well as a reference for the major important topics. So I see this as a nice book for developers who want to quickly (and cheaply) master networking Java, as well as a supplemental book for courses in continuing education courses or colleges."<br></p><h2>The Origins of Cauchy&#39;s Rigorous Calculus (Dover Books on Mathematics)</h2><p>This text for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students examines the events that led to a 19th-century intellectual revolution: the reinterpretation of the calculus undertaken by Augustin-Louis Cauchy and his peers. These intellectuals transformed the uses of calculus from problem-solving methods into a collection of well-defined theorems about limits, continuity, series, derivatives, and integrals. Beginning with a survey of the characteristic 19th-century view of analysis, the book proceeds to an examination of the 18th-century concept of calculus and focuses on the innovative methods of Cauchy and his contemporaries in refining existing methods into the basis of rigorous calculus. 1981 edition.</p><p></p><h2>Loose Leaf for Physics of Everyday Phenomena</h2><p>The Physics of Everyday Phenomena introduces students to the basic concepts of physics, using examples of common occurrences in everyday life.

This new, fully updated edition continues to provide an authoritative and highly readable introduction to key areas of theory and research in second language acquisition. Ellis presents a comprehensive overview of the different theories in this field and examines critical reactions to them. The book reflects recent trends in looking at cognitive and social aspects of second language acquisition, as well as examining the roles played by implicit and explicit instruction in language learning&#34;--Page [4] of cover.</p><p>Rod Ellis is Professor in the Department of Applied Language Studies and Linguistics at the University of Auckland, New Zealand. He has worked in Zambia, the UK, Japan, and the US for extended periods. He has published a number of books on second language acquisition and teacher education. He<br>has also published EFL/ESL textbooks.&#34;Understanding Second Language Acquisition, second edition, represents a historic scholarly achievement and unique contribution to the teaching of languages. Writing for teachers and those preparing to become teachers, Rod Ellis provides the most comprehensive and balanced overview of the field of second language acquisition available today. Theoretically and linguistically sophisticated, the text seeks to provide teachers with a ?basis for making pedagogical decisions in a principled way.? This edition contains new chapters on social and cognitive aspects of the field as well as on explicit and implicit instruction. Ellis has contributed to the preparation of generations of modern language teachers; the second edition will ensure that this vital resource will now meet the needs of a new generation.&#34; * MLA&#39;s Kenneth W. Mildenberger Prize panel * &#39;Rod Ellis has made a twofold contribution to SLA, as a researcher in his own right and as an indefatigable chronicler of the field. In this latter capacity, as the author of this book, he writes - as always - clearly, accessibly and objectively, referring to, comparing and evaluating a huge range of studies old and new, highlighting the benefits and shortcomings of different approaches to research, the theoretical assumptions behind them and the soundness of the conclusions which have been drawn from them. Throughout the text, there are clear summaries of key points, and key terms (about 220 of them) are highlighted in the text and explained in a glossary... What of the relevance of this book to English language teachers? Well, it would be hard to disagree with the author&#39;s contention that: &#34;An understanding of how learners learn a foreign language seems to me an essential requirement for language teachers.&#34;&#39; * Modern English Teacher * &#39;It is 30 years since Rod Ellis wrote the award-winning and classic Understanding Second Language Acquisition, so an update was probably well overdue... The scope of this edition is wider than its predecessor; it remain scholarly yet accessible, and it will doubtless acquire just as many enthusiastic followers.&#39; * English Teaching Professional * &#39;[Ellis] fills a gap in the SLA research base. This is a much needed source of information in the study area... This book is intended for a broad audience: undergraduate students who want to explore the field of SLA; graduate students who are involved with applied linguistics and language teaching; and teachers who want to understand better how L2 learners learn in different contexts, and also how about implicit and explicit language learning differ... The author recognizes different studies in SLA research and provides valuable information on theory and research.&#39; * Linguist List * An excellent and much-needed, in-depth review of the research on how children and literate adults learn a second language. Ellis provides a sound knowledge base for language teachers and beginning graduate students in applied linguistics, focusing on relevant findings of research on second-language learning by children and literate adults in both naturalistic and instructed contexts. * Elaine Tarone, Director of the Center for Advanced Research on Language Acquisition, University of Minnesota *</p><h2>LooseLeaf for Criminology</h2><p><i>Criminology</i> provides an in depth study of criminology in the twenty-first century in a clear, straight-forward manner, making this the most accessible offering on the market.

Drawing on many first-hand examples and numerous new case studies and interviews with grassroots activists and organizations around the world, as well as Oxfam's unrivalled global experience, this important book answers the question: how does change happen and how can we-governments, organizations, businesses, leaders, campaigners, employees, and ordinary citizens-make a difference?<br></p><p><br><strong>Duncan Green</strong> is Oxfam GB's Senior Strategic Adviser. He also teaches on international development at the London School of Economics, where he is a Professor in Practice. His blog is one of the most widely read on international development, and is named after his book <em>From Poverty to Power</em> (2nd ed., 2012). <em>How Change Happens</em> contains the accumulated experience of years spent engaged in the field, researching and writing about reducing poverty and combating injustice and, as the author says, trying to, "do justice to the complexity of the world, while still believing there is a story about how it can be changed for the better."<br><br>"In this powerfully argued book, Duncan Green shows how we can make major changes in our unequal and unjust world by concerted action, taking full note of the economic and social mechanisms, including established institutions, that sustain the existing order. If self-confidence is important for the effective agency of deprived communities, so is a reasoned understanding of the difficult barriers that must be faced and overcome. This is a splendid treatise on how to change the actual world in reality, not just in our dreams." -- Amartya Sen, Thomas W. Lamont University Professor, and Professor of Economics and Philosophy, Harvard University<p><br>"In How Change Happens, Duncan Green points to a simple truth: that positive social change requires power, and hence attention on the part of reformers to politics and the institutions within which power is exercised.

How Change Happens is a wonderful gift to all development professionals and citizens who want to make our world a better place. Only after reading and reflecting have I been able to see how badly we have needed this book. The evidence, examples, analysis, insights and ideas for action are a quiet but compelling call for reflection on errors and omissions in ones own mindset and practice. It is as relevant and important for South as North, for funders as activists, for governments as NGOs, for transnational corporations as campaigning citizens. We are all in this together. How Change Happens should stand the test of time. It is a landmark, a must read book to return to again and again to inform and inspire reflection and action." -- Robert Chambers, Research Associate, Institute of Development Studies</p><p><br>"This is a gem of a book.

When one feels despondent and disheartened then reading this book will help to encourage, energise and inspire one to participate in the creation of a better world. Duncan Green makes the case with vivid examples that significant changes have taken place and continue to take place when social and environmental activists employ skilful means and multiple strategies such as advocacy, campaigning, organising and building movements. It is a wonderful book.

Duncan Green's book is a timely and badly needed guide to bringing about the necessary social and political change." -- Mary Robinson, former President of Ireland<p></p><br>"The gift of this book is the author's ability to translate extensive political and economic readings, experience working within political institutions and agencies, and the struggles of activism into an insightful and useful handbook."--<em>America Magazine</em><p></p><br>-In this powerfully argued book, Duncan Green shows how we can make major changes in our unequal and unjust world by concerted action, taking full note of the economic and social mechanisms, including established institutions, that sustain the existing order. If self-confidence is important for the effective agency of deprived communities, so is a reasoned understanding of the difficult barriers that must be faced and overcome. This is a splendid treatise on how to change the actual world-in reality, not just in our dreams.- -- Amartya Sen, Nobel Prize-winning economist and author<p></p><br>-In <em>How Change Happens</em>, Duncan Green points to a simple truth: that positive social change requires power, and hence attention on the part of reformers to politics and the institutions within which power is exercised. It is an indispensable guide for activists and change-makers everywhere.- -- Francis Fukuyama, Senior Fellow at Stanford's Freeman Spogli Institute for International Studies<p></p><br>-It was George Orwell who wrote that 'the best books... are those that tell you what you know already.' Well, in Duncan's book <em>How Change Happens</em>, I have found something better: a book that made me think differently about something I have been doing for my entire life. He has captured so much in these pages, drawing on global and national and local change and examples from past and present. But what makes this book so insightful is that at all times we are able to see the world through Duncan's watchful eyes: from his time as a backpacker in South America to lobbying the WTO in Seattle and his many years with Oxfam, this is someone who has always been watching and always been reflecting.- -- Winnie Byanyima, Executive Director of Oxfam International<p></p><br>-Duncan has given us a remarkable tour de force, wide-ranging, readable, combining theory and practice, and drawing on his extensive reading and rich and varied experience. <em>How Change Happens</em> is a wonderful gift to all development professionals and citizens who want to make our world a better place. Only after reading and reflecting have I been able to see how badly we have needed this book. The evidence, examples, analysis, insights and ideas for action are a quiet but compelling call for reflection on errors and omissions in ones own mindset and practice. It is as relevant and important for South as North, for funders as activists, for governments as NGOs, for transnational corporations as campaigning citizens. We are all in this together. <em>How Change Happens</em> should stand the test of time. It is a landmark, a must read book to return to again and again to inform and inspire reflection and action.- -- Robert Chambers, Research Associate, Institute of Development Studies<p></p><br>-This is a gem of a book. Lucidly written and disarmingly frank, it distils the authors decades of experience in global development practice to share what can work and what may not, in changing power relations and complex systems. Again and again I found myself agreeing with him. All of us--practitioners and academics--who want a better world, and are willing to work for it, must read this book.- -- Bina Agarwal, Professor of Development Economics and Environment, Global Development Institute, University of Manchester<p></p><br>-This fascinating book should be on the bedside of any activist and many others besides. Duncan Green is the rare global activist who can explain in clear yet analytical language what it takes to make change happen. Ranging widely from Lake Titicaca in Peru to rural Tajikistan, from shanty towns to the halls of power, this is a book sprinkled with wisdom and insight on every page.- -- Dani Rodrik, Ford Foundation Professor of International Political Economy at the John F.

Students and academic researchers will find the text to be an authoritative and scholarly resource, while SEM operators and a diversity of practitioners &#x2015; engineers, technicians, physical and biological scientists, clinicians, and technical managers &#x2015; will find that every chapter has been overhauled to meet the more practical needs of the technologist and working professional. In a break with the past, this Fourth Edition de-emphasizes the design and physical operating basis of the instrumentation, including the electron sources, lenses, detectors, etc. In the modern SEM, many of the low level instrument parameters are now controlled and optimized by the microscope&#x2019;s software, and user access is restricted. Although the software control system provides efficient and reproducible microscopy and microanalysis, the user must understand the parameter space wherein choices are made to achieve effective and meaningful microscopy, microanalysis, and micro-crystallography. Therefore, special emphasis is placed on beam energy, beam current, electron detector characteristics and controls, and ancillary techniques such as energy dispersive x-ray spectrometry (EDS) and electron backscatter diffraction (EBSD).<br>With 13 years between the publication of the third and fourth editions, new coverage reflects the many improvements in the instrument and analysis techniques. The SEM has evolved into a powerful and versatile characterization platform in which morphology, elemental composition, and crystal structure can be evaluated simultaneously. Extension of the SEM into a "dual beam" platform incorporating both electron and ion columns allows precision modification of the specimen by focused ion beam milling. New coverage in the Fourth Edition includes the increasing use of field emission guns and SEM instruments with high resolution capabilities, variable pressure SEM operation, theory, and measurement of x-rays with high throughput silicon drift detector (SDD-EDS) x-ray spectrometers. In addition to powerful vendor- supplied software to support data collection and processing, the microscopist can access advanced capabilities available in free, open source software platforms, including the National Institutes of Health (NIH) ImageJ-Fiji for image processing and the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) DTSA II for quantitative EDS x-ray microanalysis and spectral simulation, both of which are extensively used in this work. However, the user has a responsibility to bring intellect, curiosity, and a proper skepticism to information on a computer screen and to the entire measurement process. This book helps you to achieve this goal.<ul><li>Realigns the text with the needs of a diverse audience from researchers and graduate students to SEM operators and technical managers<br></li><li>Emphasizes practical, hands-on operation of the microscope, particularly user selection of the critical operating parameters to achieve meaningful results<br></li><li>Provides step-by-step overviews of SEM, EDS, and EBSD and checklists of critical issues for SEM imaging, EDS x-ray microanalysis, and EBSD crystallographic measurements<br></li><li>Makes extensive use of open source software: NIH ImageJ-FIJI for image processing and NIST DTSA II for quantitative EDS x-ray microanalysis and EDS spectral simulation.<br></li><li>Includes case studies to illustrate practical problem solving<br></li><li>Covers Helium ion scanning microscopy<br></li><li>Organized into relatively self-contained modules &#x2013; no need to "read it all" to understand a topic<br></li><li>Includes an online supplement&#x2015;an extensive "Database of Electron&#x2013;Solid Interactions"&#x2015;which can be accessed on SpringerLink, in Chapter 3</li></ul></p><p>This text is written by a team of authors associated with SEM and X-ray Microanalysis Courses presented as part of the Lehigh University Microscopy Summer School.

A lot of very distinct images and schematic drawings make for a very interesting book and help readers who study scanning electron microscopy and X-ray microanalysis. The principal application and sample preparation given in this book are suitable for undergraduate students and technicians learning SEEM and EDS/WDS analyses.

Should felons be required to display bumper stickers or wear T-shirts that announce their crimes? This powerful and elegantly written book, by one of America's most influential philosophers, presents a critique of the role that shame and disgust play in our individual and social lives and, in particular, in the law.</p><br><p> Martha Nussbaum argues that we should be wary of these emotions because they are associated in troubling ways with a desire to hide from our humanity, embodying an unrealistic and sometimes pathological wish to be invulnerable. Nussbaum argues that the thought-content of disgust embodies "magical ideas of contamination, and impossible aspirations to purity that are just not in line with human life as we know it." She argues that disgust should never be the basis for criminalizing an act, or play either the aggravating or the mitigating role in criminal law it currently does. She writes that we should be similarly suspicious of what she calls "primitive shame," a shame "at the very fact of human imperfection," and she is harshly critical of the role that such shame plays in certain punishments.</p><br><p> Drawing on an extraordinarily rich variety of philosophical, psychological, and historical references--from Aristotle and Freud to Nazi ideas about purity--and on legal examples as diverse as the trials of Oscar Wilde and the Martha Stewart insider trading case, this is a major work of legal and moral philosophy.</p></p><p>Winner of the 2004 Award for Best Professional/Scholarly Book in Law, Association of American Publishers<p>"This exciting book on emotions and the law tackles universal questions central to every legal system. We may pretend that law is a wholly rational discipline. We may try to tame strong emotions. But as Martha Nussbaum shows in her analysis of the passions that influence our attitude to law and its problems, we cannot deny our human feelings. Sometimes in the law, however, we strongly need to keep them in check. Intuition, in particular, is often wrong. Disgust is sometimes based on an infantile dislike of the unfamiliar."<b>--Justice Michael Kirby, High Court of Australia</b></p><p>"This elegantly written book interweaves materials from psychoanalytic theory, ancient and contemporary moral and political philosophy, literature and law.

The principles are sound as we have tested them with our software." -John Hill, President, Futures Truth, Co.<br> <br> "Bill Williams has always been an excellent teacher, taking complex terms and concepts and translating them into a clear, commonsense approach to trading. This book provides a complete trading program that reflects Bill's years of wisdom and experience in the marketplace." -Darrell Jobman, Editorial Consultant and former Editor-in-Chief of Futures magazine<br> <br> As today's market environment continues to change dramatically, more and more traders are discovering that traditional forecasting methods-pure technical analysis and fundamental analysis-just do not work. Sending out contradictory messages, these opposing schools of thought leave investors baffled about the future direction of the market, and consequently, at a loss as to how to tailor their trading systems. As a result, many practitioners have now turned to a new forecasting "cocktail" that combines traditional charting methodologies with chaos theory and human psychology. In this groundbreaking book, Bill Williams, a seasoned trader at the forefront of this dynamic new approach, explains exactly what it is, how it works in current stock and commodity markets, and how to use it to your advantage.<br> <br> Based on human nature rather than the vagaries of the market, the new trading dimension works on the premise that we trade not the market, but our own belief system. By assessing what your personal biases are, you can determine how they influence your ultimate success-or failure-and then adjust your trading strategies accordingly.<br> <br> Written by an expert in the field who has been featured in Futures, Worth, Success, and other prominent publications, New Trading Dimensions takes the latest in scientific knowledge about human behavior and applies it directly to the fields of stock and commodity investing and trading. With straightforward guidelines, it shows you how to adopt the right attitude toward the behavior of the market and use the right tools (ATTITOOLS) for profitable trading. Packed with practice exercises, specific applications to different types of investments, and a detailed review of important market signals, here's where you'll learn how to:<br> * Discover what the market wants and align your own beliefs with the direction of the market<br> * Apply chaos theory to trading and investing<br> * Use Williams' "Market Alligator" for analyzing and profiting from the markets<br> * Employ a multidimensional trading program that includes such tools and techniques as fractals, oscillators, AC signals, psychological zones, and balance lines<br> * Exit trades in a timely fashion to reap high returns<br> <br> Drawing on the author's more than forty years of experience as both a success</p><p>Traders and sophisticated investors are increasingly finding that traditional market forecasting methods, such as fundamental analysis or technical analysis are not working as effectively in today&#39;s market conditions. Fundamental analysts have research to prove that the market is ready for a downturn, yet technical analysts provide research for the contrary. Which research is correct? As a result of these contradictions, many traders and investors have turned to a new source of approach to the markets which combines scientific theories and investment psychology. The reasoning behind this new market forecast method is that since the markets act differently now, there should be a new way to view them, as well. Bill Williams is one of the trainers who has combined these elements of traditional technical charting methodology with chaos theory and human psychology. In New Trading Dimensions, Williams discusses, in detail, this new methodology.<p><strong>Marketplace Books, Inc</strong>, an independent press and John Wiley and Sons co-publish a full line of books in the finance, business and professional subject areas.

Economic and social inequities are mediated by the social locations and lived experiences of people. The intersectionality perspective is often neglected, yet it is vital for understanding social injustice and intervening on behalf of oppressed groups. <p> In Section One, the authors propose a framework for understanding and using intersectionality to conduct research, formulate policies, develop interventions, and disseminate knowledge that improve developmental outcomes and address the economic and social disparities arising from oppression and privilege. The history of intersectionality in social work and its relevance for the professional are discussed in depth in this section. Section Two presents examples of best practices in the use of intersectionality in each of the primary domains of social work-practice, research, policy, and education and concludes with a discussion and recommendations for bringing about a fundamental change in the way social work practitioners and educators think about the profession. </p><p> Intersectionality constitutes a milestone in social work literature that crystallizes the most valuable aspects of social work theory and practice-its holistic perspective, systems-based approach, and commitment to social justice-into a powerful work that is essential reading for social workers who are interested in mitigating the oppression of marginalized groups and promoting optimal development for all people.</p><p>Also available:</p><p>A Primer on Single-Case Design for Clinical Social Workers, 2nd edition - ISBN 0871013819<br>Interactional Supervision - ISBN 0871012200</p><p>NASW Press</p><p></p><p> NASW Press, a division of National Association of Social Workers (NASW), is a leading scholarly press in the social sciences.

All previous constraints on money and credit creation were removed and a new economic paradigm took shape. Economic growth ceased to be driven by capital accumulation and investment as it had been since before the Industrial Revolution. Instead, credit creation and consumption began to drive the economic dynamic. In <i>The New Depression: The Breakdown of the Paper Money Economy</i>, Richard Duncan introduces an analytical framework, The Quantity Theory of Credit, that explains all aspects of the calamity now unfolding: its causes, the rationale for the government's policy response to the crisis, what is likely to happen next, and how those developments will affect asset prices and investment portfolios.</p> <p> In his previous book, <i>The Dollar Crisis</i> (2003), Duncan explained why a severe global economic crisis was inevitable given the flaws in the post-Bretton Woods international monetary system, and now he's back to explain what's next. The economic system that emerged following the abandonment of sound money requires credit growth to survive. Yet the private sector can bear no additional debt and the government's creditworthiness is deteriorating rapidly. Should total credit begin to contract significantly, this New Depression will become a New Great Depression, with disastrous economic and geopolitical consequences. That outcome is not inevitable, and this book describes what must be done to prevent it.</p> <ul> <li>Presents a fascinating look inside the financial crisis and how the New Depression is poised to become a New Great Depression</li> <li>Introduces a new theoretical construct, The Quantity Theory of Credit, that is the key to understanding not only the developments that led to the crisis, but also to understanding how events will play out in the years ahead</li> <li>Offers unique insights from the man who predicted the global economic breakdown</li> </ul> <p> Alarming but essential reading, <i>The New Depression</i> explains why the global economy is teetering on the brink of falling into a deep and protracted depression, and how we can restore stability.</p></p><p><br><br> <b>Q &amp; A with Richard Duncan, author of <i>The New Depression</i></b><br><br> <table> <tbody><tr> <td></td></tr> <tr> <td>Richard Duncan</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <b>This is a very ambitious book. Its theme is that a new credit-driven economic system has replaced Capitalism in recent decades and is now at risk of breaking down into a New Great Depression. Is that correct?</b><br> Yes. In 1968, when the United States stopped backing dollars with gold, the nature of money changed. The distinction between money and credit became blurred and the constraints on credit creation were eliminated. Over the next 40 years, total credit in the US expanded 50 times from $1 trillion to $50 trillion. That explosion of credit financed unprecedented global prosperity. There is now a grave danger that this new credit-fuelled economic paradigm will break down into depression because the private sector cannot bear any additional debt.<br><br> <b>But why do you call this a new economic paradigm? Isn't that just the way Capitalism works?</b><br> No. Capitalism was an economic system in which the private sector created growth through a process of investment, profit and capital accumulation (hence Capitalism), in an ongoing cycle. The government played very little role. Our economic system has not worked like that for decades. The US government now spends $25 out of every $100 spent in the economy (25% of GDP) and the central bank "creates" the money and manipulates it value. That is not Capitalism. Moreover, the economic dynamic is no longer driven by investment and capital accumulation. Our system is driven by credit creation and consumption. Creditism is a more appropriate name for it. Creditism has created extraordinarily rapid growth for decades, but now seems to have hit its limit to create more growth because the credit that has already been extended can no longer be repaid. Therefore, no further credit expansion appears possible.<br><br> <b>Why do you believe credit growth is so vital for economic growth?</b><br> Since 1952, there have only been nine years when total credit (adjusted for inflation) grew by less than 2% in the United States. Every time there was a recession; and the recession did not end until there was another large surge of credit expansion.<br><br> <b>In this book you introduce the Quantity Theory of Credit. What is that?</b><br> The Quantity Theory of Credit is an adaptation of the centuries-old Quantity Theory of Money--adapted to make it pertinent to this new age of fiat money. It is a simple, but powerful, analytical framework that explains all aspects of this crisis: its causes, the government's policy response to it thus far, what's likely to happen next and the impact that future developments will have on asset prices.<br><br> <b>On the topic of asset prices, will this book help individuals make better investment decisions?</b><br> Yes. Chapter Seven lays out scenarios of how events are likely to unfold between now and 2015; and describes how asset prices would be impacted under each scenario. Chapter Ten discusses why asset prices now move in unexpected ways compared with the way they would be expected to behave within a Capitalist system. It also discusses the prospects and consequences of inflation and deflation, as well as the advantages offered through diversification.<br><br> <b>Finally, do you believe the global economy will collapse into a New Great Depression and what will happen if it does?</b><br> The flaws of our new economic model, Creditism, are all completely obvious now. However, there are extraordinary opportunities that exist within this system that we as a society have not yet grasped. They are described in Chapter Nine. My goal in writing this book was to point out what those opportunities are so that we can avoid the terrible economic calamity that may be inevitable otherwise. Should we fail to understand and take advantage of the opportunities our new economic system presents, the economic and geopolitical consequences are likely to be dire. Chapter Eight, Disaster Scenarios, spells out just how bad things could become if we don't come to grips with the nature of our new economic system and implement a bold and imaginative strategy that ends this crisis.<br><br><p><b>Praise for The <i>New</i> Depression</b></p> <p>"The economic philosophies of John Maynard Keynes and Ludwig von Mises are obsolete. The world needs a new economist with a new economic philosophy. Richard Duncan is that new worldly economist. For years, I have recommended everyone read his books, <i>The Dollar Crisis</i> and <i>The Corruption of Capitalism</i>. Richard's latest book, The New Depression, is more than recommended reading. It is essential reading."<br> &#x2014;<b>Robert Kiyosaki</b>, founder of the Rich Dad Company and Cashflow Technologies, Inc.</p> <p>"Richard Duncan makes a strong case for paying greater attention to the role of credit creation in understanding macroeconomic performances. He makes an even stronger case for aggressive government borrowing and spending in those areas that are critical for the society's future when the private sector is unable to perform that role. This view is particularly relevant at present when private sectors in so many countries are faced with seriously impaired balance sheets following their involvement in housing bubbles. With the private sector no longer maximizing profits but minimizing debt instead, a failure to implement Richard Duncan's fiscal policy recommendations may well result in an unnecessary implosion of the world economy."<br> &#x2014;<b>Richard Koo</b>, Chief Economist, Nomura Research Institute, Tokyo</p> <p>"Richard Duncan's <i>The New Depression</i> is firstly a masterful analysis of how the credit bubble expanded and why conventional economics failed, leaving policymakers asleep at the switch. Credit, as Duncan explains, was left totally unmoored by the ending of the gold reserve requirement and by changes that allowed banks to create credit almost at will. His Quantity Theory of Credit is compelling, and once accepted, his accounting of how the depression plays out is frightening and all too believable.

It has been a central literary genre since ancient times, and has become especially popular and provocative in recent decades. This new introduction to satire takes a historically expansive and theoretically eclectic approach, addressing a range of satirical forms from ancient, Renaissance, and Enlightenment texts through contemporary literary fiction, film, television, and digital media. The beginner in need of a clear, readable overview and the scholar seeking to broaden and deepen existing knowledge will both find this a lively, engaging, and reliable guide to satire, its history, and its continuing relevance in the world.</p><p>A new history of satire that brings foundational scholarship up to date with the theoretical and historical insights of literary studies from the last three decades, this book is a substantive introduction for undergraduate and graduate students, and an essential gateway to more advanced studies.Jonathan Greenberg is Professor of English and Department Chair at Montclair State University, New Jersey, and was awarded the Andrew J.

Douglas Kahn begins by evoking the Aeolian sphere music that Henry David Thoreau heard blowing along telegraph lines and the Aelectrosonic sounds of natural radio that Thomas Watson heard through the first telephone; he then traces the histories of science, media, music, and the arts to the 1960s and beyond. <i>Earth Sound Earth Signal </i>rethinks energy at a global scale, from brainwaves to outer space, through detailed discussions of musicians, artists and scientists such as Alvin Lucier, Edmond Dewan, Pauline Oliveros, John Cage, James Turrell, Robert Barry, Joyce Hinterding, and many others.</p><p>"<i>Earth Sound Earth Signal</i> is a mind-expanding, ear-opening book,at once a history of electromagnetism in the arts and a provocation torethink the relationship between media and nature. With erudition andwit, Kahn tells the stories of artists, scientists, and engineers whohave made audible the way our planet buzzes, crackles, hums, andwhistles, from the ionosphere to the deepest depths of the oceans. Theresult is a strikingly original work about sound, aesthetics, politics,and the envinronment, from Henry David Thoreau to the Cold War to theage of global warming. It will haunt you--in a good way--long after youread it." --David Suisman, author of <i>Selling Sounds: The Commercial Revolution in American Music</i><br> <br> "Douglas Kahn's <i>Earth Sound Earth Signal</i> delivers a dazzlingly innovative study of how avant-garde music and art have made the planet itself audible over the last 200 years: the soil,the air, the atmosphere, electromagnetic radiation, and wirelesscommunications become objects of playful scientific inquiry andaesthetic enjoyment in works from Henry David Thoreau to Alvin Lucier,John Cage, Pauline Oliveros, Robert Barry, and Joyce Hinterding. <i>Earth Sound Earth Signal </i>unfolds new histories of communication, of technology, of science, and ofexperimental aesthetics in a unique fusion of sharp-eyed scholarshipwith manifesto-style punch lines. At stake is not just aesthetics orhistory, but a new idea of planetary nature: Earth perceived throughglobal and local waves, radiations, and energy flows that humans cannnot see but that become audible through media from rocks and winds toelectronic circuitry. At a time when older notions of nature no longergrasp the new global technonatures and biocultures of the twenty-firstcentury, Kahn's brilliantly insightful manifesto of 'Aelectrosonics'makes nature resonate anew in an entirely different key and at adifferent scale: It shows how Earth sings and the atmosphere makesmusic. This planetary techno-music is a must-hear for anyone interestedin experimental aesthetics, environmentalism, or globalization." --Ursula K. Heise, author of <i>Sense of Place and Sense of Planet: The Environmental Imagination of the Global</i><br> <br> "It is rare that the history of the arts and techno-sciences are sosuccessfully blended as in Douglas Kahn's magisterial survey of how theperception of natural electromagnetic phenomena entered the scientific,artistic and popular imagination. Kahn documents the inquiries of Thomas Watson, Thoreau, scientists and amateurs in the 19th and 20th centuries and moves on to Alvin Lucier, John Cage and contemporary composers andscientific inquiry. This is a fundamental text for all collaborationsbetween the arts and sciences today." --Roger Malina, Professor of Artand Technology and Professor Of Physics, University of Texas at Dallas<br> <br> "A fascinating tour through previously untold episodes in media artshistory. From its theoretical moves to 'think energy' and attend to itslively presence in communications and the arts, to its fresh historicaldetail on experimental works by artists such as Alvin Lucier and Pauline Oliveros, Earth Sound Earth Signal should appeal broadly to scholars,artists, and enthusiasts of media and sound." --Tara Rodgers, composerand author of <i>Pink Noises: Women on Electronic Music and Sound</i> <br> <br> "Douglas Kahn is one of the most inspiring scholars dealing with sound and art. He's able to accurately track historically compelling behind-the-scenes facts, while retrieving and connecting visionary trajectories across aesthetics and (especially) scientific domains. This long awaited book is an excellent collection of author's writings and is truly interdisciplinary, ranging equally proficiently over science, telecommunications history, sound and art.... The significance of experiments undertaken during the period from the end of 19th century until now, compose a detailed and extensively explored picture of primal forces coded and decoded as data and meaning carriers (in a way they are "media"), making this book another unmissable text in sound art research." --Alessandro Ludovico, <i>Neural Magazine</i> <br><br> "In Douglas Kahn's <i>Earth Sound Earth Signal: Energies and Earth Magnitude in the Arts</i>, the premise is holistic. Signals are everywhere, running through us, the earth, the sky, bouncing off the ionosphere, and the best way to tune into them is by listening. By the time you've finished reading this book you feel like you've tapped into a magnificent universal circuit. It's almost religious... The book offers vast amounts of fascinating information ranging from background stories around the creation of artworks to mythic descriptions of natural phenomena, such as auroras and static storms at high altitude, which are utterly enthralling. However the dominant achievement is that Kahn manages to rough-up the binary of nature and technology. As he extrapolates on his theory of the Aelectrosonic--the sounds of the electromagnetic world--he repositions nature at the centre of electronic music and indeed of media arts. It all starts with the signals that have been waiting for us to invent ways to hear them... Most of all, the book offers a comprehensive and mind-altering understanding of the connectedness between ourselves, the Earth and all of these shimmering energetic properties. Douglas Kahn invites us to tune in to this awesome totality." --Gail Priest, <i>RealTime</i> <br><br>"<i>Earth Sound Earth Signal </i>is a phenomenal book... It reorients sound studies by attending to phenomena that have been marginalized within the discussion - the glitches and glissandi deemed 'noise' by a history that has largely been written from the perspective of audio technologies intended for sonic reproduction and high fidelity auditory experience. In taking up earth's sounds and signals, it rewrites existing tendencies and assumptions about technology, nature, and culture, and their respective boundaries, undoing binaries and commonly held meanings. And by the end it makes it all seem obvious: that radio is nature, that bodies are technological, and that the noise of technology might be musical. Just as earth sounds and signals are existing phenomena that telephonic technologies brought into the realm of human perception, the book makes us aware of things encountered but not formulated, leaving us with a resounding feeling of the inevitability of it all. This is achieved through an impressive scale of research that brings together wide-ranging fields of inquiry, stitched together with a deft analysis that treats the material - physical, energetic, auditory, aesthetic - as historically situated." --Marina Peterson, author of <i>Sound, Space, and the City: Civic Performance in Downtown Los Angeles</i><b>Douglas Kahn</b> is Professor of Media and Innovation at the National Institute for Experimental Arts at the University of New South Wales, Australia.

It also teaches how to write Verilog HDL in a productive and maintainable style that enables CAD tools to do much of the tedious work. A complete introduction to digital design is given through clear explanations, extensive examples and online Verilog files. The teaching package is completed with lecture slides, labs and a solutions manual for instructors. Assuming no previous digital knowledge, this textbook is ideal for undergraduate digital design courses that will prepare students for modern digital practice. &#34;Dally and Harting blend circuit and architecture design in a clear and constructive manner on the basis of their exceptional experience in digital design. Students will discover a modern and effective way to understand the fundamental underpinning of digital design, by being exposed to the different abstraction levels and views of computing systems.&#34; - Giovanni De Micheli, EPFL Switzerland &#34;Bill and Curt have combined decades of academic and industry experience to produce a textbook that teaches digital system design from a very practical perspective without sacrificing the theoretical understanding needed to train tomorrow&#39;s engineers. Their approach pushes students to understand not just what they are designing but also what they are building. By presenting key advanced topics, such as synthesis, delay and logical effort, and synchronization, at the introductory level, this book is in the rare position of providing both practical advice and deep understanding. In doing so, this book will prepare students well even as technology, tools, and techniques change in the future.&#34; - David Black-Schaffer, Uppsala University &#34;Everything you would expect from a book on digital design from Prof. Dally. Decades of practical experience are distilled to provide the tools necessary to design and compose complete digital systems. A clear and well written text that covers the basics and system-level issues equally well. An ideal starting point for the microprocessor and SoC designers of the future!&#34; - Robert Mullins, University of Cambridge and the Raspberry Pi Foundation &#34;This textbook sets a new standard for how digital system design is taught to undergraduates. The practical approach and concrete examples provides a solid foundation for anyone who wants to understand or design modern complex digital systems.&#34; - Steve Keckler, The University of Texas at Austin &#34;This book not only teaches how to do digital design, but more importantly shows how to do good design. It stresses the importance of modularization with clean interfaces, and the importance of producing digital artifacts that not only meet their specifications, but which can also be easily understood by others. It uses an aptly-chosen set of examples and the Verilog code used to implement them. It includes a section on the design of asynchronous logic, a topic that is likely to become increasingly important as energy consumption becomes a primary concern in digital systems. The final appendix on Verilog coding style is particularly useful. This book will be valuable not only to students, but to practitioners in the area. I recommend it highly.&#34; - Chuck Thacker, Microsoft</p><p>This book provides students with a system-level perspective and the tools they need to understand, analyze and design complete digital systems using Verilog.

But we now live in what President Obama has called "an age without surrender ceremonies," where it is no longer easy to distinguish between times of war and times of peace.<br><br>In this inventive meditation on war, time, and the law, Mary Dudziak argues that wartime is not as discrete a time period as we like to think. Instead, America has been engaged in some form of ongoing overseas armed conflict for over a century. Meanwhile policy makers and the American public continue to view wars as exceptional events that eventually give way to normal peace times. This has two consequences: first, because war is thought to be exceptional, "wartime" remains a shorthand argument justifying extreme actions like torture and detention without trial; and second, ongoing warfare is enabled by the inattention of the American people. More disconnected than ever from the wars their nation is fighting, public disengagement leaves us without political restraints on the exercise of American war powers.<br></p><p><br><strong>Mary L. Dudziak</strong> is Asa Griggs Candler Professor of Law, Emory Law School. Her books include <em>Exporting American Dreams: Thurgood Marshall's African Journey</em> and <em>Cold War Civil Rights</em>.<br><br>"[Mary Dudziak's] essential argument is persuasive and her contribution is significant. She helps explain why national security continues to have such influence on American politics, why the US continues to field such a large military establishment, and why this country exercises such influence and engages in such frequent interventions in world politics."--<em>Journal of American History</em><p></p><br>"Thoughtful, compelling, and concise."--<em>H-War</em><p></p><br>"Closely argued and clearly written, this is a scholarly work with popular appeal."--<em>Publishers Weekly</em><p></p><br>"For over a decade since 9/11, U.S. forces have been waging war. Yet is the nation itself 'at war'? In this timely and provocative book, Mary Dudziak shows why this question has become so difficult to answer--and warns of the dangers inherent in our failure to do so." --Andrew J . Bacevich, author of <em>Washington Rules: America's Path to Permanent War</em><p></p><br>"<em>War Time</em> turns our notions of both 'war' and 'time' upside down. This thought-provoking book forces us to realize that war is not an exception to 'normal' peacetime, but rather that wartime has become the norm. The implications of perpetual wartime are profound, for law, politics, and daily life. Mary Dudziak has again brought her keen cultural, historical and legal insights to bear on a subject of critical importance."--Elaine Tyler May, Regents Professor, University of Minnesota <br><p></p><br>"Taking law as her focal point but ranging much more widely, Mary Dudziak's provocative meditation on what we mean in speaking of a 'time' of war invites readers to reflect on how we think about war itself. It should change our understanding of what-and when-war 'is' for Americans."--Mark Tushnet, William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Law, Harvard Law School<p></p><br>"<em>War Time</em> is one of those rare books that can entirely reorient how one thinks about the world. By showing the reader what Americans have meant-and have come to mean-by 'wartime,' Mary Dudziak shows us assumptions about war and peace that govern political and legal thought without anyone noticing. This is an intellectual tour de force, and beautifully written to boot."--H. Jefferson Powell , George Washington Law School<p></p><br>"[T]his is a book well worth reading."--<em>New York Journal of Books</em><p></p><br>"A slim and engaging volume, wonderfully written and carefully wrought, <em>War Time</em> is a fascinating meditation on the perils of clinging to a myth of national identity that increasingly bears only a glancing resemblance to modern life."--<em>H-Diplo</em><p></p><br>"Mary Dudziak's new book, <em>War Time: An Idea, Its History, Its Consequences</em>, is a crucial document. Her smooth foray into legal and political history reveals that in not just the past decade but the past century, wartime has become a more or less permanent feature of the American experience, though we fail to recognize it....Dudziak assembles an intellectual Rubik's Cube, playing with ideas of time, law, killing and politics, and arranging them into a pattern that all but eliminates the distinctions we long assumed to have existed between war and peace."--<em>The Nation</em><p></p><br>"Humanists will regard much Dudziak's text as an anecdotally rich and sprightly written reestablishment of the threshold claim that culture and society affect temporal categories and experience....For humans, at least, individual and collective experience is not that of the clock ticking equivalent seconds but the packaging of meaning through temporal definition. 'Wartime,' Dudziak can therefore add, is not an objective fact about history but a fashion of assigning significance with its own cultural style and political implications. Dudziak reveals and exploits this truth beautifully."--Lawfare.com<p></p><br>"Drawing thoughtfully from the literature of legal studies, political science, history and sociology, Dudziak crafts a fascinating and nuanced narrative tracing the progressive expansion of U.S. national security interests and the complex ramifications."--<em>Washington Post</em><p></p><br>"This is an intriguing little book...[A] thoughtful and original take on the concept of war."--<em>Foreign Affairs</em><br><p></p><br>"This is an important book...It has the potential to reshape how we interpret post-1945 American History."--<em>Journal of American History</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Biology for the IB Diploma Second Edition</h2><p><p><b>Provide clear guidance to the 2014 changes and ensure in-depth study with accessible content, directly mapped to the new syllabus and approach to learning.</b><br>This second edition of the highly regarded textbook contains all SL and HL content, which is clearly identified throughout.

Over the next four years, that cause claimed the lives of some 13 million soldiers--more than twice the number killed in all the major wars from 1790 to 1914. But despite this devastating toll, the memory of the war was not, predominantly, of the grim reality of its trench warfare and battlefield carnage. What was most remembered by the war's participants was its sacredness and the martyrdom of those who had died for the greater glory of the fatherland. <br> War, and the sanctification of it, is the subject of this pioneering work by well-known European historian George L. Mosse. <em>Fallen Soldiers</em> offers a profound analysis of what he calls the Myth of the War Experience--a vision of war that masks its horror, consecrates its memory, and ultimately justifies its purpose. Beginning with the Napoleonic wars, Mosse traces the origins of this myth and its symbols, and examines the role of war volunteers in creating and perpetuating it. But it was not until World War I, when Europeans confronted mass death on an unprecedented scale, that the myth gained its widest currency. Indeed, as Mosse makes clear, the need to find a higher meaning in the war became a national obsession. Focusing on Germany, with examples from England, France, and Italy, Mosse demonstrates how these nations--through memorials, monuments, and military cemeteries honoring the dead as martyrs--glorified the war and fostered a popular acceptance of it. He shows how the war was further promoted through a process of trivialization in which war toys and souvenirs, as well as postcards like those picturing the Easter Bunny on the Western Front, softened the war's image in the public mind. <br> The Great War ended in 1918, but the Myth of the War Experience continued, achieving its most ruthless political effect in Germany in the interwar years. There the glorified notion of war played into the militant politics of the Nazi party, fueling the belligerent nationalism that led to World War II. But that cataclysm would ultimately shatter the myth, and in exploring the postwar years, Mosse reveals the extent to which the view of death in war, and war in general, was finally changed. In so doing, he completes what is likely to become one of the classic studies of modern war and the complex, often disturbing nature of human perception and memory.<br></p><p><br><strong>George L.

What is less clear is how this will be managed and deployed as a multi-polar world system is being born. The full implications of this challenge cry out to be understood because city building (and retrofitting) cannot but be an undertaking entangled in profound societal and cultural shifts.<br><br> In this highly original account, renowned urban sociologists AbdouMaliq Simone and Edgar Pieterse offer a call for action based fundamentally on the detail of people's lives. Urban regions are replete with residents who are compelled to come up with innovative ways to maintain or extend livelihoods, whose makeshift character is rarely institutionalized into a fixed set of practices, locales or organizational forms. This novel analytical approach reveals a more complex relationship between people, the state and other agents than has previously been understood.

"We live our lives; we tell our stories. It is as natural as breathing." It is as important as breathing, too. History shapes our self-definition and our relationship to community; it locates us in time and place and helps to give meaning to our lives. History can be the vital thread that holds a nation together, as demonstrated most strikingly in the case of Jewish history. Conversely, for women, who have lived in a world in which they apparently had no history, its absence can be devastating. In <em>Why History Matters</em>, Lerner brings together her thinking and research of the last sixteen years, combining personal reminiscences with innovative theory that illuminate the importance of history and the vital role women have played in it.<br> <em>Why History Matters</em> contains some of the most significant thinking and writing on history that Lerner has done in her entire career--a summation of her life and work. The chapters are divided into three sections, each widely different from the others, each revelatory of Lerner as a woman and a feminist. We read first of Lerner's coming to consciousness as a Jewish woman. There are moving accounts of her early life as a refugee in America, her return to Austria fifty years after fleeing the Nazis (to discover a nation remarkable both for the absence of Jews and for the anti-Semitism just below the surface), her slow assimilation into American life, and her decision to be a historian. If the first section is personal, the second focuses on more professional concerns. Included here is a fascinating essay on nonviolent resistance, tracing the idea from the Quakers (such as Mary Dyer), to abolitionists such as Theodore Dwight Weld (the "most mobbed man" in America), to Thoreau's essay <em>Civil Disobedience</em>, then across the sea to Tolstoy and Gandhi, before finally returning to America during the civil rights movement of the 1950s. There are insightful essays on "American Values" and on the tremendous advances women have made in the twentieth century, as well as Lerner's presidential address to the Organization of American Historians, which outlines the contributions of women to the field of history and the growing importance of women as a subject of history. The highlight of the final section of the book is Lerner's bold and innovative look at the issues of class and race as they relate to women, an essay that distills her thinking on these difficult subjects and offers a coherent conceptual framework that will prove of lasting interest to historians and intellectuals.<br> A major figure in women's studies and long-term activist for women's issues, a founding member of NOW and a past president of the Organization of American Historians, Gerda Lerner is a pioneer in the field of Women's History and one of its leading practitioners. <em>Why History Matters</em> is the summation of the work and thinking of this distinguished historian.<br></p><p>For historian Gerda Lerner, the personal and the professional are inextricably linked. Recently retired from her position as a professor of history at the University of Wisconsin, Lerner has crafted a profound and powerful meditation on what history means to her, and why it should matter to us. The essays in <i>Why History Matters</i> strongly connect Lerner's Judaism and her dual roles as feminist and historian: "To be a Jew means to live history," she writes, while Judaism's divisions between the sexes--particularly its denial of full participation in synagogue to women--eventually led to her embrace of feminism and her pioneering work in the field of women's history. <p> The position of women and other oppressed groups is of paramount interest to Lerner, and the longest essay in this collection deals with her theories of patriarchy as the father of all discriminatory systems. Class and race are other issues that concern Lerner, and they crop up again here in her discussion of the differences between black and white women's views of feminism. Sex, class, and race--all the hot-flash points at work in today's society--are accounted for in <i>Why History Matter</i>. There are connections, Lerner argues, between the violence, poverty, racism, and sexism we see all around us and the attitudes and events of the past. She has spent her life tracing these causes and effects, encouraged by her belief that understanding the past ensures a better future. And that, Gerda Lerner insists, is why history matters.</p><br><strong>Gerda Lerner</strong> is Robinson-Edwards Professor of History, <em>Emerita</em>, at the University of Wisconsin, Madison.<br></p><h2>The Oxford Handbook of Aquinas (Oxford Handbooks)</h2><p>Thomas Aquinas (1224/6-1274) lived an active, demanding academic and ecclesiastical life that ended while he was still comparatively young. He nonetheless produced many works, varying in length from a few pages to a few volumes.<br><br>The present book is an introduction to this influential author and a guide to his thought on almost all the major topics on which he wrote. The book begins with an account of Aquinas's life and works. The next section contains a series of essays that set Aquinas in his intellectual context. They focus on the philosophical sources that are likely to have influenced his thinking, the most prominent of which were certain Greek philosophers (chiefly Aristotle), Latin Christian writers (such as Augustine), and Jewish and Islamic authors (such as Maimonides and Avicenna). The subsequent sections of the book address topics that Aquinas himself discussed. These include metaphysics, the existence and nature of God, ethics and action theory, epistemology, philosophy of mind and human nature, the nature of language, and an array of theological topics, including Trinity, Incarnation, sacraments, resurrection, and the problem of evil, among others. These sections include more than thirty contributions on topics central to Aquinas's own worldview. The final sections of the volume address the development of Aquinas's thought and its historical influence. <br><br>Any attempt to present the views of a philosopher in an earlier historical period that is meant to foster reflection on that thinker's views needs to be both historically faithful and also philosophically engaged. The present book combines both exposition and evaluation insofar as its contributors have space to engage in both. This Handbook is therefore meant to be useful to someone wanting to learn about Aquinas's philosophy and theology while also looking for help in philosophical interaction with it.<br></p><p><br><strong>Brian Davies</strong> is Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at Fordham University.<br><br><strong>Eleonore Stump</strong> is Robert J.

Henry's father, believing Catherine to be wealthy, invites her to be a guest at Northanger Abby, the family's country estate. Catherine, who has read too many Gothic romances and who is possessed of too vivid an imagination, views the abbey as a house of nightmarish horror &#x2014; an aspect of the book that gleefully parodies the fantastic Gothic romances by Ann Radcliffe and other popular writers of the period. An amusing assortment of misunderstandings and plot twists result in the satisfying romantic conclusion characteristic of the author&#x2019;s works.<br>First written in 1789-99, when Austen was in her early twenties, this novel, like <i>Persuasion, </i>did not see publication till 1818, in the winter after the author's death. Distinguished by its satirical wit, brilliant comedy, and complex but subtle views of human nature and morality, the book also presents a fine background picture of middle-class life in nineteenth-century England, with particularly good scenes in Bath, the fashionable watering place to which Austen's father, a clergyman himself, had retired. <i>Northanger Abbey</i> is a must-read for all Austen fans and students of English literature.</p><p>Though <i>Northanger Abbey</i> is one of Jane Austen's earliest novels, it was not published until after her death--well after she'd established her reputation with works such as <i>Pride and Prejudice</i>, <i>Emma</i>, and <i>Sense and Sensibility</i>. Of all her novels, this one is the most explicitly literary in that it is primarily concerned with books and with readers. In it, Austen skewers the novelistic excesses of her day made popular in such 18th-century Gothic potboilers as Ann Radcliffe's <i>The Mysteries of Udolpho</i>. Decrepit castles, locked rooms, mysterious chests, cryptic notes, and tyrannical fathers all figure into <i>Northanger Abbey</i>, but with a decidedly satirical twist. Consider Austen's introduction of her heroine: we are told on the very first page that "no one who had ever seen Catherine Morland in her infancy, would have supposed her born to be an heroine." The author goes on to explain that Miss Morland's father is a clergyman with "a considerable independence, besides two good livings--and he was not in the least addicted to locking up his daughters." Furthermore, her mother does <i>not</i> die giving birth to her, and Catherine herself, far from engaging in "the more heroic enjoyments of infancy, nursing a dormouse, feeding a canary-bird, or watering a rose-bush" vastly prefers playing cricket with her brothers to any girlish pastimes. <p> Catherine grows up to be a passably pretty girl and is invited to spend a few weeks in Bath with a family friend. While there she meets Henry Tilney and his sister Eleanor, who invite her to visit their family estate, Northanger Abbey. Once there, Austen amuses herself and us as Catherine, a great reader of Gothic romances, allows her imagination to run wild, finding dreadful portents in the most wonderfully prosaic events. But Austen is after something more than mere parody; she uses her rapier wit to mock not only the essential silliness of "horrid" novels, but to expose the even more horrid workings of polite society, for nothing Catherine imagines could possibly rival the hypocrisy she experiences at the hands of her supposed friends. In many respects <i>Northanger Abbey</i> is the most lighthearted of Jane Austen's novels, yet at its core is a serious, unsentimental commentary on love and marriage, 19th-century British style. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>One of the first of Jane Austen&#39;s novels to be written, and one of the last to be published, Northanger Abbey is both an amusing story of how a naive girl enters society and wins the affection of a witty young clergyman, and a high-spirited parody of the lurid Gothic novels that were popular during Austen&#39;s youth. In the process it features a vivid account of social life in late eighteenth-century Bath, and Austen&#39;s famous defence of the novel as a literary form. This edition, based on the text of the novel as published posthumously in 1818, is accompanied by explanatory notes, and an appendix summarising the plots and situations of the Gothic fictions that form the basis of much of Austen&#39;s comedy. In addition there is an extensive critical introduction covering the context, publication, and critical history of the novel, a chronology of Austen&#39;s life, and authoritative textual apparatus.</p><h2>Soils: Genesis and Geomorphology</h2><p>In its first edition, Soils established itself as the leading textbook in the fields of pedology and soil geomorphology.

Since 1995 Bantin has been actively involved in developing strategies for managing electronic recordsThis much-needed resource in this age of digital information includes contributions from 42 repository experts working in higher education, government, or business. Each of the 10 chapters targets an essential conceptual area related to digital repositories, and approaches that concept via one theoretical essay and at least one case study (most chapters offer two or three case studies). Concepts cover the spectrum from selecting a trusted repository to ensuring an established repository&#x2019;s security. Theoretical essays approach the topic by describing strategies, their evolution, and current state; highlighting models, standards, and policies; explaining projects that incorporate advanced knowledge in the field; and identifying helpful resources for additional information. Case studies (aka "implementations") explain background, context, and projected goals; delineate techniques used, obstacles faced, and results gleaned; then finally share project evaluations and lessons learned. Each chapter introduces field-related acronyms and promising software packages, presents data in tables or charts, and offers images or graphs of models and processes to aid readers. The text closes by analyzing the current state of repositories and offering a future prediction of their complex interconnectedness. Well researched and written. Summing Up: Recommended.

It is a world where clinical practitioners evaluate how drug users speak about themselves and their problems, and where the ideal of "healthy" talk is explicitly promoted, carefully monitored, and identified as the primary sign of therapeutic progress. The book explores the puzzling question: why do addiction counselors dedicate themselves to reconciling drug users' relationship to language in order to reconfigure their relationship to drugs?</p><br><p> To answer this question, anthropologist Summerson Carr traces the charged interactions between counselors, clients, and case managers at "Fresh Beginnings," an addiction treatment program for homeless women in the midwestern United States. She shows that shelter, food, and even the custody of children hang in the balance of everyday therapeutic exchanges, such as clinical assessments, individual therapy sessions, and self-help meetings. Acutely aware of the high stakes of self-representation, experienced clients analyze and learn to effectively perform prescribed ways of speaking, a mimetic practice they call "flipping the script."</p><br><p> As a clinical ethnography, <i>Scripting Addiction</i> examines how decades of clinical theorizing about addiction, language, self-knowledge, and sobriety is manifested in interactions between counselors and clients. As an ethnography of the contemporary United States, the book demonstrates the complex cultural roots of the powerful clinical ideas that shape therapeutic transactions--and by extension administrative routines and institutional dynamics--at sites such as "Fresh Beginnings."</p></p><p><p>"<i>Scripting Addiction</i> is an original and meticulous ethnographic account of a decidedly post-Freudian 'talking cure,' in a treatment program for drug addiction. One of the book's notable successes is its account of how clients acquire skills necessary for reading, analyzing, and strategically responding to the social-service transactions that are integral to their lives."<b>--Allan Young, McGill University</b></p><p>"Summerson Carr explores the consequential nexus of language, personhood, therapy, welfare policy, and social-work practice with imagination and subtlety. Deeply textured and intellectually exhilarating, <i>Scripting Addiction</i> is a rich and revelatory account of a specific therapeutic site and an extraordinary model for attuned, reflective, and generative ethnography. This is certain to become a classic in the anthropology of complex institutions--and of the broader ideologies and social relations with which they are entangled."<b>--Donald Brenneis, University of California, Santa Cruz</b></p><p>"Pathbreaking. The book incorporates a fine-grained ethnography of drug treatment and treatment philosophies, and will make a substantial contribution to our understanding of how language and identity function in this institutional setting. Carr displays a deft facility for articulating a number of important perspectives in social work, drug therapy, social theory, and linguistic theory. <i>Scripting Addiction</i> is a scholarly masterpiece."<b>--Gregory M. Matoesian, author of <i>Law and the Language of Identity</i></b></p><p>"A fascinating contribution to scholarship. Carr has very effectively, thoroughly, and skillfully used ethnography and sociolinguistics to empirically demonstrate the dark side of clinical language practices. Her careful linguistic approach methodically shows how therapeutic language can be used to constrain rather than open up possibilities."<b>--Jerry Floersch, author of <i>Meds, Money, and Manners: The Case Management of Severe Mental Illness</i></b></p><b>E.

Rich in anecdote and insight, <strong></strong><strong><em>Vested Interests</em></strong><strong></strong> offers a provocative and entertaining view of our ongoing obsession with dressing up--and with the power of clothes.</p><p>Director of the Humanities Center at HarvardAn elaborate theory by Garber (English/Harvard), insisting that the transvestite is at the elusive heart of Western culture. In a century-sweeping book, Garber applies current critical thought to the phenomenon of ``cross-dressing'' in fact and fiction, high culture and low. Arguing that gender is culturally constructed, she contends that cross-dressing challenges the binary categories of male and female as well as the concept of category itself. It signals ``cultural, social or aesthetic dissonances.'' Garber argues that critics have looked ``through,'' not ``at,'' the transvestite, failing to see what is a Freudian ``primal scene.'' Defined here again and again, the transvestite is ``the space of desire,'' ``a space of possibility,'' a ``third.'' Garber plays out her theory in detailed analyses of countless transvestite figures- -Shakespearean heroines, Tootsie, Lawrence of Arabia, M. Butterfly, Madonna, and Laurence Olivier (here portrayed at death as ``the triumphant transvestite''). There is no shortage of provocative speculation and information, some worth considering and some--like that about transvestite magazines and the politics of transsexual surgery--not. Unfortunately, the sub-flooring of French critical terms sets Garber's argument on a slippery slope ending up too often in a theoretical mire where ``the transvestite is both a signifier and that which signifies the undecidability of signification.'' A discussion of Elizabethan dress codes and costuming concludes with the typically reductive claim that ``there is no ground of Shakespeare that is not already cross-dressed.'' Also, when critical terms are rampantly applied--Elvis and Liberace, for instance, labeled, like Peter Pan, ``changeling boys''--they quickly lose impact. Bound for controversy, this study admirably attempts to cross from the academy to popular culture, but theory here acts less as a window onto cultural evolution than as a screen drawing attention its own overwrought, repetitive pattern.

Tsitsi Jaji argues that African American popular music appealed to continental Africans as a unit of cultural prestige, a site of pleasure, and most importantly, an expressive form already encoded with strategies of creative resistance to racial hegemony. Ghana, Senegal and South Africa are considered as three distinctive sites where longstanding pan-African political and cultural affiliations gave expression to transnational black solidarity. The book shows how such transnational ties fostered what Jaji terms "stereomodernism." Attending to the specificity of various media through which music was transmitted and interpreted-poetry, novels, films, recordings, festivals, live performances and websites-stereomodernism accounts for the role of cultural practice in the emergence of solidarity, tapping music's capacity to refresh our understanding of twentieth-century black transnational ties.<br></p><p><br><strong>Tsitsi Ella Jaji</strong> is Assistant Professor of English at the University of Pennsylvania.<br><br>"<em>Africa in Stereo</em> raises the bar with new insights into both the sonic and visual realms of art. Transcriptions, performance, poetry, print and new media formats elucidate how Africans on the continent and in the diaspora have been engaged in a continuous dialogue and exchange of cultural particulars throughout the twentieth century. A major contribution is the author's willingness to move beyond a particular village or ethnic group (conventional units of ethnographic analysis) and focus instead on South Africa, Senegal and Ghana, drawing from an interesting array of archival materials to highlight and tease out the forces that made the impulse towards solidarity between Africa and the diaspora possible." -- Mumbua Kioko, <em>Volume! The French journal of popular music studies</em><p></p><br>"Meticulously researched, historically and politically exigent, and adventurous in its archival reach, Africa in Stereo is a path-breaking book that pulsates to the beat of literary, visual, sonic and cultural studies. Tsitsi Jaji has built a bold new sound system for diaspora studies that challenges us to listen closely to the crosscurrents of African aesthetic technologies that forge and inform our modern world." --Daphne Brooks, author of <em>Bodies in Dissent: Spectacular Performances of Race and Freedom, 1850-1910</em><p></p><br>"This book is unique in its attentiveness to the intricacies, significances and pleasures of listening, notation and reading. It recasts - with great subtlety and eloquence - our understanding o fthe sonic, visual, and literary practices used by Africans in the elaboration and pursuit of pan-Africanism at home and abroad." --Bhekizizwe Peterson, author of <em>Monarchs, Missionaries, and African Intellectuals</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Hypatia: The Life and Legend of an Ancient Philosopher (Women in Antiquity)</h2><p>A philosopher, mathematician, and martyr, Hypatia is one of antiquity's best known female intellectuals. During the sixteen centuries following her murder, by a mob of Christians, Hypatia has been remembered in books, poems, plays, paintings, and films as a victim of religious intolerance whose death symbolized the end of the Classical world. But Hypatia was a person before she was a symbol. Her great skill in mathematics and philosophy redefined the intellectual life of her home city of Alexandria. Her talent as a teacher enabled her to assemble a circle of dedicated male students. Her devotion to public service made her a force for peace and good government in a city that struggled to maintain trust and cooperation between pagans and Christians. <br><br>Despite these successes, Hypatia fought countless small battles to live the public and intellectual life that she wanted. This book rediscovers the life Hypatia led, the unique challenges she faced as a woman who succeeded spectacularly in a man's world, and the tragic story of the events that led to her tragic murder.<br></p><p><br>The Alkiviadis Vassiliadis Chair and Professor of History at the University of California, San Diego, Edward Watts studies the intellectual and religious history of the later Roman and early Byzantine Empires.

Gouv�a, Colby College<p></p><br>"This monograph is undoubtedly an important addition to the scholarship on Hypatia, not least because there has been no monograph-length study for more than two decades. Arguably one of the most significant contributions of this study is the argument that the murder of Hypatia was not, as is often argued in the existing scholarship, a pre-meditated attack but rather a circumstantial event. Apart from Hypatia's life, this book is also notable for painting a detailed picture of late-antique Alexandria and for showing how much information about an ancient figure can be teased out of indirect evidence about historical circumstances, parallel cases and similar. The writing style is extremely accessible. Quite a few comparisons to modern history and popular culture-although almost exclusively American-make the book very approachable to a wide range of audiences, not only the specialists." --Aiste Celkyte, <em>Bryn Mawr Classical Review</em><p></p><br>"Watts' account of Hypatia's life is a work of scholarship, the product of some very thorough research, which provides a detailed and plausible interpretation of the life of a fascinating woman ... I would recommended this book for a university rather than school library, though it might have an appeal for a school pupil with an interest in studying prominent female figures in antiquity ... It is also a book for the thoughtful reader who wishes to examine their own beliefs about how to live the good life and its compatibility with public life." --Alison Henshaw, <em>Classics for All</em><p></p><br>"Watts is most compelling in the summations of his findings and narratives...A careful historical portrait of one of antiquity's most accomplished women." --Steve Young, <em>Library Journal</em> <br><p></p><br>"To shine as a mathematician; to alter decisively the teaching curriculum of an ancient university; to work for the peace of an explosive city: Hypatia of Alexandria had done all this before her senseless murder by a Christian mob in 415 CE. With zest and exemplary scholarship, Ed Watts has brought alive the vivid world of Alexandria that both made Hypatia's achievements possible and also led to her unexpected, shocking death. It is a book that shows that truth is stranger (and a lot more interesting) than the rose-tinted fiction which has usually enveloped the life and death of this remarkable woman." --Peter Brown, Princeton University<p></p><br>"Hypatia of Alexandria led an exceptional life as a celibate teacher of philosophy and political adviser. Edward Watts uses his expert knowledge of her city, and of late antique education, to explain the content and context of her teaching, and to show how Alexandria made possible both her career and her appalling death. Hypatia's death made her a symbol of repression, but for her, philosophy was a way of life, and that is the focus of this excellent book." --Gillian Clark, University of Bristol<p></p><br>"Immersing Hypatia into her world of competing philosophers, jockeying bishops and local potentates, loyal students and rival monks, Watts restores the brilliant mathematician and philosophical leader, a woman all but submerged under the mask her violent death created. In the process, he also evokes the fabric of cosmopolitan late Roman Alexandria, a city in which Christians and others coexisted despite tensions that could and did erupt into moments of spectacular violence." --Susanna Elm, University of California, Berkeley<p></p><br></p><h2>Ancient Oaxaca (Case Studies in Early Societies, Series Number 2)</h2><p>Just after 500 B.C., one of the earliest states in the New World developed in the Valley of Oaxaca, in present-day Mexico.

Too frequently these debates devolve to simple judgments&#x2015;good or bad, life-saving medicine or bioethical nightmare, symbol of human ingenuity or our fall from grace&#x2015;ignoring the people affected. With this book, Ruha Benjamin moves the terms of debate to focus on the shifting relationship between science and society, on the people who benefit&#x2015;or don't&#x2015;from regenerative medicine and what this says about our democratic commitments to an equitable society. <i>People's Science</i> uncovers the tension between scientific innovation and social equality, taking the reader inside California's 2004 stem cell initiative, the first of many state referenda on scientific research, to consider the lives it has affected. Benjamin reveals the promise and peril of public participation in science, illuminating issues of race, disability, gender, and socio-economic class that serve to define certain groups as more or less deserving in their political aims and biomedical hopes. Under the shadow of the free market and in a nation still at odds with universal healthcare, the socially marginalized are often eagerly embraced as test-subjects, yet often are unable to afford new medicines and treatment regimes as patients. Ultimately, Ruha Benjamin argues that without more deliberate consideration about how scientific initiatives can and should reflect a wider array of social concerns, stem cell research&#x2015; from African Americans' struggle with sickle cell treatment to the recruitment of women as tissue donors&#x2015;still risks excluding many. Even as regenerative medicine is described as a participatory science for the people, Benjamin asks us to consider if "the people" ultimately reflects our democratic ideals.</p><p>Ruha Benjamin is an Assistant Professor of African American Studies at Princeton University, and is a Faculty Associate in the Program on the History of Science, the Center for Health and Wellbeing, the Program in Gender and Sexuality Studies, and the Center for Global Health and Health Policy at Princeton.

In <i>People's Science</i>, Benjamin offers us an engaging, insightful, and challenging call to examine both the rhetoric and reality of innovation and inclusion in science and science policy. Using a clear and persuasive, moral, and sometimes even prophetic voice, Benjamin calls sociologists of science, technology, and medicine to investigate ever more deeply how scientific innovation works within a deeply unequal society, advantaging the already powerful and ignoring or silencing those who suffer from existing public policy."

Morrison)<br><br>"Telling the story of the social and political lives of stem cells in America, Ruha Benjamin compels you to consider how political expedience and vague promises of a better future too often trump social equity in publicly funded scientific research.

(Michael Montoya <i>University of California, Irvine, author of <i>Making the Mexican Diabetic: Race, Science, and the Genetics of Inequality</i></i>)<br><br>"Ruha Benjamin powerfully contests the autonomy of scientists and argues instead for a radically inclusive public engagement in science.

Science of the people, by the people and for the people does not always mean <i>all</i> the people." (Dalton Conley <i>New York University</i>)<br><br>"Much of the debate over stem cell research is seen in the public eye as part of the ongoing struggles between Left and Right, liberal and conservative.

Recommended." (M. D. Lagerwey)<br><br>"Some of the most pressing questions for science today start not with 'Can...?', but 'How...?' . . . Ruha Benjamin's excellent book focuses on such questions, taking as a case study of controversial passage of Proposition 71, a state bill that made conducting stem cell research in California a Constitutional right, and which guaranteed funding . . . for stem cell research over a decade." (Neil Singh <i><i>British Journal of the History of Science</i></i>)<br><br>"In this fascinating account of an experiment both political and scientific, Ruha Benjamin takes us behind the scenes of California's massive, voter-driven investment in stem cell research. <i>People's Science</i> examines the tread marks where the rubber meets the road: Whose interests are served, whose bodies provide the raw research materials, and which groups reap the benefits? This is a must-read contribution to our understanding of health disparities, 'biological citizenship,' and the politics of knowledge-making."

Choice<br><br>"The Cambridge Companions to Literature series enjoys a well-deserved reputation for scholarly excellence. The volume on Kafka, happily, is no exception to the rule.... The single best thing about the volume, indeed, is the willingness (and the ability) of almost all of its contributors to break away from comfortably traditional critical judgments.... This excellent volume does not claim to present us with any master keys that might serve to unlock [Kafka's] secrets; rather, it challenges us, as the best criticism always does, to return to the text with new eyes, new expectations, and a willingness to see things differently."

Beginning with a general model of the firm, Hart analyzes in greater depth the financial structure of firms, debt collecting and bankruptcy. Oliver Hart is a leading researcher in this area, and these Clarendon Lectures are an important contribution to contact theory. The work will be of interest to teachers, graduate students and advanced students of microeconomics, the theory of the firm, industrial organization, and finance.<br></p><p>This book provides a framework for thinking about economic institutions such as firms. The basic idea is that institutions arise in situations where people write incomplete contracts and where the allocation of power or control is therefore important. Power and control are not standard concepts in economic theory. The book begins by pointing out that traditional approaches cannot explain on the one hand why all transactions do not take place in one huge firm and on the other hand why firms matter at all. An incomplete contracting or property rights approach is then developed. It is argued that this approach can throw light on the boundaries of firms and on the meaning of asset ownership. In the remainder of the book, incomplete contracting ideas are applied to understand firms&#39; financial decisions, in particular, the nature of debt and equity (why equity has votes and creditors have foreclosure rights); the capital structure decisions of public companies; bankruptcy procedure; and the allocation of voting rights across a company&#39;s shares. The book is written in a fairly non-technical style and includes many examples. It is aimed at advanced undergraduate and graduate students, academic and business economists, and lawyers, as well as those with an interest in corporate finance, privatization and regulation, and the transition from socialism to capitalism. Little background knowledge is required, since the concepts are developed as the book progresses and the existing literature is fully reviewed.<br>Oliver Hart is Professor of Economics at Harvard University.<br></p><h2>An Introduction to the Russian Folktale (Complete Russian Folktale (Paperback))</h2><p>This introduction to the Russian folktale considers the origin, structure and language of folktales; tale-tellers and their audiences; the relationship of folktales to Russian ritual life; and the folktale types which are translated in subsequent volumes of The Complete Russian Folktale.</p><p>This engaging introduction to the Russian folktale considers the origin, structure, and language of folktales; tale-tellers and their audiences; the relationship of folktales to Russian ritual life; and the folktale types that will be presented in translation in subsequent volumes of The Complete Russian Folktale.<p>CONTENTS</p><p>I.

His range extends beyond these traditional genres to tragicomedies, masques, pageants, pamphlets, epigrams, and Biblical and political commentaries, written alone or in collaboration with Shakespeare, Webster, Dekker, Ford, Heywood, Rowley, and others. Compared by critics to Aristophanes and Ibsen, Racine and Joe Orton, he has influenced writers as diverse as Aphra Behn and T. S. Eliot. Though repeatedly censored in his own time, he has since come to be particularly admired for his representations of the intertwined pursuits of sex, money, power, and God.<br><br><em>The Collected Works </em>brings together for the first time in a single volume all the works currently attributed to Middleton. It is the first edition of Middleton's works since 1886. The texts are printed in modern spelling and punctuation, with critical introductions and foot-of-the-page commentaries; they are arranged in chronological order, with a special section of Juvenilia. The volume is introduced by essays on Middleton's life and reputation, on early modern London, and on the varied theatres of the English Renaissance. Extensively illustrated, it incorporates much new information on Middleton's life, canon, texts, and contexts. A self-consciously 'federal edition', <em>The Collected Works</em> applies contemporary theories about the nature of literature and the history of the book to editorial practice.<br></p><p><br><strong>Gary Taylor</strong>, George Matthew Edgar Professor of English and Director of the program in the History of Text Technologies at Florida State University, was joint General Editor of Shakespeare's <em>Complete Works</em> (Oxford, 1986; revised 2005).

Four hundred alphabetically arranged entries touch on virtually every aspect of African religious belief, from Africa's great epic themes (dualistic gods, divine tricksters, creator gods, and heroes) to descriptions of major mythic systems (the Dogon, the Asante, and the San) and beyond. <br><br> Scheub covers the entire continent, from the mouth of the Nile to the shores of the Cape of Good Hope, including North African as well as sub-Saharan cultures. His retellings provide information about the respective belief system, the main characters, and related stories or variants. Perhaps most important, Scheub emphasizes the role of mythmaker as storyteller--as a performer for an audience. He studies various techniques, from the rhythmic movements of a Zulu mythmaker's hands to the way a storyteller will play on the familiar context of other myths within her cultural context. <br><br> An invaluable bridge to the richly diverse oral cultures of Africa, this collection uncovers a place where story and storyteller, tradition and performance, all merge.<br></p><p>There's no Zeus with his thunderbolt or Thor with his hammer; but in Harold Scheub's <i>A Dictionary of African Mythology</i>, there is Kibuka, who shoots arrows from clouds, and Tanit, mother of the universe, with her spear. From over 10 years of living in Africa, Harold Scheub has combed oral and recorded traditions to deliver a treasury of African mythology. Scheub focuses on the art of the storyteller, presenting stories that animate the peoples that tell them. You'll find the full range of archetypal figures here and see how mythic scenarios can vary from region to region. There are the rain-stones from God; the crocodile women; and Wuni, the god who destined men to always have to chase women. Scheub ties the stories together by locating common themes and provides an immense bibliography, along with cross-referencing by culture and country. Africa is not often on our mythology radar, but Scheub demonstrates that the continent's traditions are every bit as colorful and transformative as the myths of other world cultures. <i>--Brian Bruya</i><br><strong>Harold Scheub</strong> is Professor of African Languages and Literature at the University of Wisconsin--Madison.

American foods enriched their diets. Furs, precious metals, dyes, and many other products underwrote new luxury trades, and tobacco became the first consumer craze as the price plummeted with ever-enlarging production. <br>Much of the technology that made new initiatives, such as sailing out of sight of land, possibly drew on Asian advances that came into Europe through North Africa. Sugar and other crops came along the same routes, and Europeans found American environments ideal for their cultivation. Leaders along the African coast controlled the developing trade with Europeans, and products from around the Atlantic entered African life. As American plantations were organized on an industrial scale, they became voracious consumers of labor. American Indians, European indentured servants, and enslaved Africans were all employed, and over time slavery became the predominant labor system in the plantation economies.<br>American Indians adopted imported technologies and goods to enhance their own lives, but diseases endemic in the rest of the world to which Americans had no acquired immunity led to dramatic population decline in some areas. From Brazil to Canada, Indians withdrew into the interior, where they formed large and powerful new confederations.<br>Atlantic exchange opened new possibilities. All around the ocean, states that had been marginal to the main centers in the continents' interiors now found themselves at the forefront of developing trades with the promise of wealth and power. European women and men whose prospects were circumscribed at home saw potential in emigration. Economic aspirations beckoned large numbers, but also, in the maelstrom following the Reformation, others sought the chance to worship as they saw fit. Many saw their hopes dashed, but some succeeded as they had desired. Ultimately, as people of African and European descent came to predominate in American populations, they broke political ties to Europe and reshaped transatlantic relationships.<br></p><p><br><strong>Karen Ordahl Kupperman</strong> is Silver Professor of History at New York University and author of <em>Indians and English: Facing Off in Early America,</em> among many other works on Atlantic history.<br><br>"Recommended."--<em>CHOICE</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Business Law: Text &amp; Exercises</h2><p>Now you can focus on the basics of business law principles with BUSINESS LAW: TEXT AND EXERCISES, 9E.

Nearly one in 50 people, excluding children and the elderly, is incarcerated today, a rate unsurpassed anywhere else in the world. What are some of the main political forces that explain this unprecedented reliance on mass imprisonment? Throughout American history, crime and punishment have been central features of American political development. This 2006 book examines the development of four key movements that mediated the construction of the carceral state in important ways: the victims&#39; movement, the women&#39;s movement, the prisoners&#39; rights movement, and opponents of the death penalty. This book argues that punitive penal policies were forged by particular social movements and interest groups within the constraints of larger institutional structures and historical developments that distinguish the United States from other Western countries.</p><p>Throughout American history, crime and punishment have been central features of American political development.

What makes this rigorously tested modular treatment unique is that it is explicitly designed with flexibility and individualization in mind. Developed in a real-world, highly diverse community mental health context, the treatment can be continually adjusted to target motivational problems, disruptive behavior, family issues, and other frequently encountered clinical roadblocks. In a large-size format for easy photocopying, the book includes a detailed case formulation framework, a flexible treatment planning algorithm, and over 90 pages of user-friendly reproducibles.</p><p>Bruce F. Chorpita, PhD, is Professor in the Department of Psychology and the Department of Psychiatry and Biobehavioral Sciences at the University of California, Los Angeles. He is an internationally recognized expert on childhood anxiety disorders and on innovations in treatment design and dissemination."Dr. Chorpita scores with this one. Although much has been written about evidence-based practice, in this volume Chorpita demonstrates how it can actually be accomplished in 'real-world' clinical settings. He takes us on a journey that starts with core principles of client engagement and continues through to a clear clinical formulation and the flexible yet informed selection of suitable treatment modules. There is no 'one size fits all' in this modular approach; the clinician is ultimately responsible for selecting those modules that will likely work with a given child or adolescent client. This volume is scholarly yet immensely practical. It belongs in the armamentarium of anyone who works with anxious and phobic youth and their families."--Thomas H. Ollendick, PhD, ABPP, University Distinguished Professor and Director, Child Study Center, Department of Psychology, Virginia Tech<br><br> "This remarkable volume marks the beginning of a major shift in the field of psychotherapy research and treatment, not just for childhood anxiety disorders, but for all mental disorders. Chorpita's modular approach is highly intelligent, clinically savvy, and eminently feasible. If this approach can be applied across the range of mental conditions that therapists try to treat, it has the potential to move psychotherapy practice and training to much higher scientific ground. This book is clinically rich and very well written. It should be required reading for all who would offer effective psychotherapy to children, and is a 'must' for psychotherapy training programs."--Peter S. Jensen, MD, Columbia University&nbsp;"This book is the ideal entry point to evidence-based treatment for clinicians who have been reluctant to adopt manualized approaches. It is also a wonderful teaching tool. Chorpita not only presents background information and tools for cognitive-behavioral treatment of childhood anxiety disorders, but he also takes into account the roadblocks clinicians frequently encounter. He includes modules addressing disruptive behavior, parent behaviors interfering with progress, depression, poor motivation, and social skills deficits, to be used as needed in the service of facilitating anxiety treatment. This book advances the field in presenting an established treatment together with flexible solutions to real-world clinical challenges."--Margo Thienemann, MD, Stanford University&nbsp;"Dr. Chorpita&#x2019;s use of treatment modules applied through detailed individual formulations is a revolutionary development in the management of childhood anxiety disorders. It combines the best of both worlds, as a clear manualized treatment with scope for individual application. Add to this Dr. Chorpita&#x2019;s years of clinical experience, his humane and humorous writing style, and the practical applications and illuminating examples, and this book becomes essential reading for any therapist who works with anxious children and their families."--Ronald M. Rapee, PhD, Macquarie University, Australia<br><br>"Dr. Chorpita delivers magnificently with this scholarly yet practical, clinically rich, and extremely readable offering. Those familiar with the benefits and limitations of standard treatment manuals will appreciate this book....Dr. Chorpita maximizes the benefits of a manualized approach while avoiding many of the pitfalls by organizing this manual as a set of modules that can be flexibly included in or omitted from the final treatment plan. He increases the flexibility of this modular approach further by emphasizing methods to increase client engagement and encouraging early, precise clinical case formulation....This book deserves to be a well-worn, dog-eared reference in the professional library of any clinician who works with anxious children.", <i>NASP Communiqu�</i> Published On: 2006-11-05<br><br>"A comprehensive and informative book....Bruce F.

His book covers everything from engaging new patients, to understanding the concepts and fundamentals behind cognitive-behavioral therapy, to developing sound case formulations....Although Chorpita is instructive and directive in his approach, his book is not just a step-by-step manual, but more of an aid for clinicians who want both behavioral guidelines and clinical insights that will enhance their approach to treatment. The sections on assessment, exposure, and troubleshooting are especially helpful, and they are supplemented with useful handouts and extensive references....Almost a stand-alone course in cognitive-behavioral therapy....The book is a welcome addition to the treatment literature and a fine personal resource for clinicians.", <i>Journal of the American Academy of Child and Adolescent Psychiatry</i> Published On: 2006-11-05<br><br>"This is an excellent book for any clinician working with childhood anxiety disorders. It is thorough, well illustrated with examples, simply written, clear, and reflective of the many years of experience of its author.

In addition to examining the urban dimensions of such topics as community formation and continuity, minority and majority dynamics, ethnic experience, poverty, power, and crime, it provides an analysis of the spatial distribution of population and resources with regard to the metropolitanization of the urban form, and the interaction between urban concentration and development and underdevelopment. From a first chapter that begins with a discussion of some of the more micrological features of the urban experience, the text focuses on the significance of the more macrological cultural, social organizational, and political dimensions of urban change, in an historical span that includes the first cities and concludes with an exploration of the implications of cyberspace, transnationalism, and global terrorism for the future of urban sociology. While the work focuses primarily on the North American case, its analytical and integrated discussion makes it applicable to urban societies in general.</p><p>William G. Flanagan is professor of sociology at Coe College.Flanagan&#39;s approach provides a richly historical and social theoretical view for understanding urban development. This book provides students with understanding both the changing urban form and the power of cities in societies, from early settlements to world urbanization. This accessible, yet sophisticated account of major debates in urban sociology is a wonderful teaching tool and reference guide. Readers can learn of key trends in urban development, in the intellectual understanding of the city, and in the policy responses that have been attempted by individuals and social groups to organize urban life through community development, social networks, economic institutions, and political agencies, such as national governments. The grand scope that Flanagan provides on urban growth and transformations allows students to imagine the urban world of the past as well as the future. This is an excellent foundational source for students.

Like death, illness raises important philosophical issues. But unlike death, illness, and in particular the experience of being ill, has received little philosophical attention. This may be because illness is often understood as a physiological process that falls within the domain of medical science, and is thus outside the purview of philosophy. In Phenomenology of Illness Havi Carel argues that the experience of illness has been wrongly neglected by philosophers and proposes to fill the lacuna. Phenomenology of Illness provides a distinctively philosophical account of illness. Using phenomenology, the philosophical method for first-person investigation, Carel explores how illness modifies the ill person's body, values, and world. The aim of Phenomenology of Illness is twofold: to contribute to the understanding of illness through the use of philosophy and to demonstrate the importance of illness for philosophy. Contra the philosophical tendency to resist thinking about illness, Carel proposes that illness is a philosophical tool. Through its pathologising effect, illness distances the ill person from taken for granted routines and habits and reveals aspects of human existence that normally go unnoticed. Phenomenology of Illness develops a phenomenological framework for illness and a systematic understanding of illness as a philosophical tool.<br></p><p><br>Havi Carel, <em>University of Bristol</em><br><br>Havi Carel is Professor of Philosophy at the University of Bristol, where she also teaches medical students. Her research examines the experience of illness and of receiving healthcare. She was recently awarded a Senior Investigator Award by the Wellcome Trust, for a five year project entitled 'Life of Breath' (with Prof Jane Macnaughton, Durham University). She has previously published on the embodied experience of illness, wellbeing within illness and patient-clinician communication in the Lancet, BMJ, Journal of Medicine and Philosophy, Theoretical Medicine and Bioethics, Medicine, Healthcare and Philosophy, and in edited collections. Havi is the author of Illness (2008, 2013), shortlisted for the Wellcome Trust Book Prize, and of Life and Death in Freud and Heidegger (2006). She is the co-editor of Health, Illness and Disease (2012) and of What Philosophy Is (2004).<br><br>"<em>Phenomenology of Illness</em> provides a compelling way forward in thinking through the complexities, ambiguities, and uncertainties of health and illness and disability. This is also a book that is eminently readable. While Carel is definitely issuing a call to arms for philosophers and healthcare professionals, this book is also clear and accessible enough for medical humanists, healthcare researchers and clinicians, those with a budding interest in philosophy and those experiencing, anticipating, or responding to illness." -- Anna K. Swartz, <em>Metapsychology </em><p></p><br>"Carel seems to have written <em>Phenomenology of Illness</em> with multiple audiences in mind: philosophers, health-care professionals and students, and people who have chronic illnesses. She has much to say to philosophers, but her writing is clear and accessible to readers without a philosophy background as wellELI was fortunate enough to have the opportunity to test and validate this claim with the help of medical students and nursing PhD students this semester. This text was an extremely valuable resource for helping students to develop a greater understanding of the ways illness drastically changes a person's life as a whole. I have high hopes that these students will be more attuned to their patients' concerns as a result of their engagement with this book." --<em>Hypatia Reviews Online</em> <br><p></p><br></p><h2>Forensic Nursing: A Handbook for Practice</h2><p>Developed within a holistic, caring framework, and well grounded in theory and research, the Second Edition continues to provide a unique and comprehensive look at forensic nursing from an interdisciplinary perspective, and addresses the need for collaborative practice and skill in caring for victims of violence and disaster, as well as in competently assisting in investigations.

Continuing the story he began in the best-selling <em>Radical Enlightenment</em> , and now focusing his attention on the first half of the eighteenth century, he returns to the original sources to offer a groundbreaking new perspective on the nature and development of the most important currents in modern thought. <br><br>Israel traces many of the core principles of Western modernity to their roots in the social, political, and philosophical ferment of this period: the primacy of reason, democracy, racial equality, feminism, religious toleration, sexual emancipation, and freedom of expression. He emphasizes the dual character of the Enlightenment, and the bitter struggle between on the one hand a generally dominant, anti-democratic mainstream, supporting the monarchy, aristocracy, and ecclesiastical authority, and on the other a largely repressed democratic, republican, and "materialist" radical fringe. He also contends that the supposedly separate French, British, German, Dutch, and Italian enlightenments interacted to such a degree that their study in isolation gives a hopelessly distorted picture.<br><br>A work of dazzling and highly accessible scholarship, <em>Enlightenment Contested</em> will be the definitive reference point for historians, philosophers, and anyone engaged with this fascinating period of human development.<br></p><p><br><strong>Jonathan Israel </strong>is Professor of Modern European History, Institute for Advanced Study, Princeton.<br><br>"<em>Enlightenment Contested</em> is full of wonderful things."--John Dunn, <em>Literary Review</em><p></p><br>"Mr. Israel's groundbreaking interpretation looks to establish itself as the one to beat."--<em>The Economist</em><p></p><br>"An enormously impressive piece of shcholarship.

This is the world of Gregory Wisdom, a physician, magician, and consummate con-man in sixteenth-century London. Drawing on previously unknown documents to reconstruct this extraordinary man's career, Alec Ryrie takes us through the cut-throat business of early modern medicine, down to Tudor London's gangland of fraud and organized crime; from the world of Renaissance magi and Kabbalistic conjurers to street-corner wizards; and into the chaotic, exhilarating religious upheavals of the Reformation. On the way, we learn how Tudor England's dignified public face and its rapacious underworld were intimately connected to each other. Gregory Wisdom's career is an object lesson in how to conjure up wealth and respectability from nothing in a turbulent age. Praised as "an excellent snapshot of a time intrigued by the spiritual realm" (<em>Los Angeles Times</em>), this is a unique glimpse into a world intoxicated by new ideas.</p><p><br><strong>Alec Ryrie</strong> is Professor of Theology and Religion at Durham University.<br>Review from previous edition: "It would be hard not to love this book.

It's a great story, an exciting piece of detective work, a portrait of some delectably appalling characters, and tells us much that is new about the Tudor underworld of crime and magic."<br><br>--Ronald Hutton, author of The Triumph of the Moon: A History of Pagan Witchcraft<br><br>"Ryrie displays his customary elegant wit in illuminating Tudor England from unexpected angles, not least in revealing that piety and Protestantism, thuggery and fraud, can be entertainingly close in their kinship. This is religion without any decline in magic."<br><br>--Diarmaid MacCulloch, author of Reformation: Europe's House Divided<br><br>"This is the past seen from the inside, and from as low a vantage as possible.

Starting from what can be pieced together about one obscure figure, he opens up a world of con - men, magicians, prostitutes, astrolgers, dubious doctors and aristocrats down on their<br>luck.

It is intended for students new to the subject matter, especially those with little mathematical training, and similarly challenged ethnographers, ethnologists, and archaeologists who are familiar with the principles of foraging theory but have never mastered any of its individual models. There are more of them than one might think. The diet breadth model is the backbone of hunter-gatherer foraging research.</p><p>Robert L. Bettinger, University of California, Davis, Davis, CaliforniaThis book would make an excellent accompaniment to many anthropology and archaeology courses, both at high school and college levels. [...] There is a lot of well-written material crammed into this little book! I highly recommend it for anyone interested not only directly with hunter-gatherer research, but for anyone who wonders how-we-know what we think we know about ancient day-to-day life. ' (Bob Wishoff <i>The Dirt Brothers (http://dirtbrothers.org/)</i> 2010-01-00)<br><br>This book is the first of its kind to provide a suite of tools applicable to many ethnographic and archaeological foraging problems. Anyone who considers themselves involved in human behavioral ecology should work through this book. It is certainly required for any student of the discipline, and as it finds its way into the classroom and onto the desks of practitioners, it is sure to become a classic.' (Brian F. Codding, Stanford University <i>California Archaeology 2.2</i> 1900-01-00)<br><br>...could be used well as an adjunct or ancillary text for a number of different courses in quantitative methods, hunter-gatherers, or foraging economy.....succeeds overall very well and very nicely in what it aims to do.'

It consists of four introductory chapters, dealing in particular with rhythm and formular techniques, followed by the detailed commentary which aims at helping serious readers by attempting to identify and deal with most of the difficulties which might stand in the way of a sensitive and informed response to the poem. The Catalogues in Book 2 recieve especially full treatment. The book does not include a Greek text - important matters pertaining to the text are discussed in the commentary. It is hoped that the volume as a whole will lead scholars to a better understanding of the epic style as well as of many well-known thematic problems on a larger scale. This Commentary will be an essential reference work for all students of Greek literature. Archaeologists and historians will also find that it contains matters of relevance to them.</p><p>The first volume of a projected six-volume commentary on Homer&#39;s Iliad.

Despite the much publicized delays in the publication and editing of the Scrolls, practically all of them had been made public by the time of the fiftieth anniversary of the first discovery. That occasion was marked by a spate of major publications that attempted to sum up the state of scholarship at the end of the twentieth century, including <em>The Encyclopedia of the Dead Sea Scrolls</em> (Oup 2000). These publications produced an authoritative synthesis to which the majority of scholars in the field subscribed, granted disagreements in detail. <br> A decade or so later, <em>The Oxford Handbook of the Dead Sea Scrolls</em> has a different objective and character. It seeks to probe the main disputed issues in the study of the Scrolls. Lively debate continues over the archaeology and history of the site, the nature and identity of the sect, and its relation to the broader world of Second Temple Judaism and to later Jewish and Christian tradition. It is the Handbook's intention here to reflect on diverse opinions and viewpoints, highlight the points of disagreement, and point to promising directions for future research.</p><p>Timothy H.

Carter, a struggling writer, set about composing a &#x201c;record of a voyage of the mind.&#x201d; The voyage begins with Carter&#x2019;s furiously good-humored description of how, every time he leaves the house, he must face the possibility of being asked &#x201c;the hated question&#x201d; (namely, Why did you, a black man born in America, come to Bern?). It continues with stories of travel, war, financial struggle, the pleasure of walking, the pain of self-loathing, and, through it all, various experiments in what Carter calls &#x201c;lacerating subjective sociology.&#x201d; Now this long-neglected volume is back in print for the first time since 1973.</p></p><p><b>Vincent O. Carter</b> (1924&#x2013;1983) was born and raised in Kansas City, Missouri. During World War II, he stormed the beaches at Normandy and took part in the liberation of Paris. On returning to America, he went to Lincoln University on the GI Bill, tried graduate school, but then, longing for escape, left the US for France, then Holland, then Germany, before settling in Bern, where he lived from 1953 until his death. Carter is also the author of the novel <i>Such Sweet Thunder</i>, available from Steerforth Press.<p><b>Since I Have Lived in the City of Bern:</b></p><p>Whether I have idled over a glass of wine in the M�venpick or in the Casino, or dined with friends, a week seldom goes by in which some new acquaintance does not approach me with a host of questions, most of which I can handle rather easily. <i>He</i> asks, "Aren't you cold!" if it is winter, and, "Aren't you happy now that the sun is shining!"&#x2015;if the sun is shining. In the first case I reply, "Yes," and in the second case, which is unfortunately very rare, "Yes indeed!" <i>She</i> asks, "How long have you been in Switzerland?"</p><p>"Oh, about three and a half years now . . ." I reply.</p> <p>"So long!" she exclaims, while I try to smile as surprisedly as her exclamation seems to warrant.</p> <p>On a less auspicious occasion It asks me rather suspiciously and with a somewhat anxious twist of the lips, or with perhaps a smile which might be a sort of half-timid apology, "How do you like it?" Its smile (I pause a little at this point in order to heighten effect) deepening before my answer, "Oh . . . I like it well enough . . ." issues from my mouth, as though He, She or It would dismiss the expected derisive remark before I intoned it.</p> <p>The conversation rambles on a bit after that but I see that my interlocutor is not satisfied. He has never or seldom met a real black man before. He has, however, heard much and wondered much. He knows or has heard one or three Negro spirituals and he is an ardent jazz fan. He studies me as inconspicuously as he can, comparing the strong definite impression before his eyes with all the images he has seen and heard of during a lifetime. Finally he hazards another question:</p> <p>"Are you a musician?"</p> <p>"No," I reply&#x2015;coldly.</p> <p>"Student?" he persists, noticing now my ancient briefcase, remembering that he has seldom seen me without it.</p> <p>"No, I'm not a student," I reply, a little irritated but not altogether unsympathetic. This has happened to me many times. I am only irritated because my invention is running out and because I fear that I might not tell my tale interestingly. His curiosity is so great, he apparently expects so much, much more, in fact, than I can ever hope to give him. It makes me sad.</p> <p>"I just thought you might be a student. There are so many medical students in town."</p> <p>"Oh no! . . . no . . . " I reply with an uneasy smile, feeling that I have been a little mean, seeing that I will have to go through it once more, racking my brain for a new way to tell it and, finding none, suffering myself now because he does not come right out and ask me.</p> <p>The conversation dawdles on. He hopes that he will find out indirectly, I think, really moved by his discretion, and yet not wishing to be indiscreet myself by volunteering information which is not directly asked for.</p> <p>"How do you like Bern?" he asks during a lull. And I reply, "Oh, I like it all right," a little grateful that we are at last getting down to specifics. In the meanwhile he has heard me make an appointment with one of the young men sitting at our table for two o'clock the next day. The departing friend had at first suggested ten in the morning, but then changed to two o'clock in the afternoon because he had forgotten that he had a class at ten in the morning. At two o'clock in the afternoon almost everybody works in Bern.</p> <p>"I see you have plenty of free time," he remarks with a nervous laugh. "You're lucky not to have to go to the <i>Buro</i>," by which he means office.</p> <p>"I can't write all the time!" I reply at last.</p> <p>His face lights up.</p> <p>Write? Write what? I hear him thinking a split second before he inquires:</p> <p>"You're a journalist?"</p> <p>"No," I reply.</p> <p>"He writes stories!" the friend who introduced him to me exclaims a little impatiently. At this point I light my pipe and try to think of an opening line, for now will come, I know, the question which I do not like because it is so difficult to answer. Even so, I am grateful for the little time which answering this question will give me because the one which comes after that will shake me to my very foundations!</p></p><h2>The Collected Poems of Philip Lamantia</h2><p>The <i>Collected Poems of Philip Lamantia</i> represents the lifework of the most visionary poet of the American postwar generation. Philip Lamantia (1927-2005) played a major role in shaping the poetics of both the Beat and the Surrealist movements in the United States. First mentored by the San Francisco poet Kenneth Rexroth, the teenage Lamantia also came to the attention of the French Surrealist leader Andr� Breton, who, after reading Lamantia&#x2019;s youthful work, hailed him as a &#x201c;voice that rises once in a hundred years.&#x201d; Later, Lamantia went &#x201c;on the road&#x201d; with Jack Kerouac and shared the stage with Allen Ginsberg at the famous Six Gallery reading in San Francisco, where Ginsburg first read &#x201c;Howl.&#x201d; Throughout his life, Lamantia sought to extend and renew the visionary tradition of Romanticism in a distinctly American vernacular, drawing on mystical lore and drug experience in the process. The <i>Collected Poems</i> gathers not only his published work but also an extensive selection of unpublished or uncollected work; the editors have also provided a biographical introduction.</p><p>&#x201c;Philip Lamantia&#x2019;s &#x2018;Collected Poetry&#x2019; is beyond scale, weight, or measure. There is no proportion in this intertwining of soul-buildings. These are the inexorable and ineffable projects of an inspired consciousness set at full tilt in raging protest, kisses, prayers, blessings and outraged demands. All from the deepest silence and farthest travel. The reader&#x2019;s excitement is carried by Lamantia&#x2019;s spiritual and physical beat. This surreal and mantic project drives farther than anything before or after. Breathtaking! These works are of synesthetic beauty to the eye, the ear, and the open interior of the heart. They come from the peaks and herbs and forests where the meadowlark speaks.&#x201d; &#x2015;Michael McClure<br> <br> "Philip Lamantia's poems are about rapture as a condition. They are spiritual and erotic at the same time. Bright and dark, the enclosed polarities of devotion. St. Teresa and Rimbaud."&#x2015;Tom Clark, author of <i>Light &amp; Shade: New and Selected Poems</i><br> <br> "The blade-flash of Lamantia&#x2019;s word lode strikes the owl stone, arcs to inspire. A quotidian American surrealism? Sudden array of Lemmy Cautions dashing through a hundred identical hotel doors. Visions for sure. Quick! Akhamatova in Lemuria!" &#x2015;Clark Coolidge<br> &nbsp;<b>Garrett Caples</b> is a poet and editor for City Lights Books and the editor of the American poetry series, City Lights Spotlight. <b>Andrew Joron </b>is an award-winning surrealist poet and translator. <b>Nancy Joyce Peters</b> is the co-owner of City Lights Books; for much of its history, she served as its executive director and publisher, until her retirement in 2008.

The book attempts to provide an overview of African history without getting bogged down in details and data. This approach is very useful for general readers who seek to gain an understanding of the major trends and developments, and for teachers who plan to supplement this text with primary sources depending on the emphasis of the course. Beginning with the dynasties of the Nile valley, Collins explains the importance of language in identifying the enormous human diversity of the Africans, the evolution of African societies into kingdoms and empires through new social structures, the introduction of Christianity and Islam, and the migrations of various groups. The book then describes the appearance of the Europeans in the fifteenth century and the rise of the Atlantic slave trade. It continues with the brief but traumatic period of colonial rule and the nationalist movements for independence that ensued. Finally, it accounts for the struggles of Africans in recent years, including civil conflict, military dictatorships, and ethnic insurgencies, as the newly independent states of the continent mature. Robert O. Collins, University of California at Santa Barbara, is the author of eighteen books.</p><p>About Robert O. Collins: Robert O. Collins, professor of history at the University of California, Santa Barbara, is the author of Shadow in the Grass: Britain in the Southern Sudan, 1919-1956 and The Waters of the Nile: Hydropolitics and the Jonglei Canal, 1900-1988, as well as 24 other books."Robert O. Collins, already well-known for his "Problems in African History" (Markus Wiener, 1992) and "Documents from the African Past" (Markus Wiener, 2001), has presented us with an elegantly written narrative that takes us from prehistoric times to contemporary Africa in fewer than 250 pages. Needless to say, the text is concise, and it is precisely for its brevity that it is important for the readers to understand what Collins has achieved in this work....Given its characteristics, this book will be a valuable tool for teachers and graduate students. Certain chapters can also be useful for course reading in introductory courses, although these need to be carefully chosen. Finally, historians of Africa will also benefit from reading this text. Like any good work of synthesis it will encourage reconceptionalization and reassessment and thus will contribute to the exploration of old and new questions." -- <i>African Studies Review</i><br><br>"Robert O.

Such is not the case of Robert Collins, Professor Emeritus of African History at the University of California at Santa Barbara and a distinguished expert on the history of the Southern Sudan. Collins' wide variety of publications, including this Short History, stands as proof of his capacity to write insightfully--over a career spanning more than forty-five years--on general as well as highly specialized topics. Professor Collins established his reputation with The Southern Sudan 1883-1898: A Struggle for Control (1962), his revised Yale PhD disserta-ion, and reaffirmed it with Shadows in the Grass: Britain in the Southern Sudan, 1918-1956 (1983). Alone or with collaborators, Collins has also written or compiled a number of volumes intended for undergraduate survey courses in African history, particularly his Problems in African listory: The Precolonial Centuries, now in its third edition. Professor Collins must have had his "Problems..." book in mind when structuring the present volume. He presents the history of Africa coherently--from the dawn of humankind to the present--in only 232 pages, alternating between detailed descriptions of key issues, followed by broad generalizations that lead to more rounds of detailed descriptions, and then more generalizations. This recurring pattern begins with a short Introduction and runs through six chapters covering (i) "Prehistoric Africa"; (ii) "Ancient and Medieval Africa"; (in) "Islam, Trade, and States"; (iv) "Europeans, Slaver --<i>African Studies Review</i></p><h2>The Anger of Achilles: M�nis in Greek Epic (Myth and Poetics)</h2><p><p>"Menis opens for consideration an immense range of significant poetic possibilities, not the least of which is that of an ethical sense for the term."&#x2015;Bryn Mawr Classical Review</p><p>"Henceforth no one will be able to claim that menis merely connotes strong emotion. Muellner has demonstrated that menis is a critical component of the workings of both the human and divine cosmos.

His point of departure is the anthropology of emotions. He believes that notions of anger vary between cultures and that the particular meaning of a word such as menis needs to emerge from a close study of Greek epic. Menis means more than an individual's emotional response. On the basis of the epic exemplifications of the word, Muellner defines the term as a cosmic sanction against behavior that violates the most basic rules of human society. To understand the way menis functions, Mueller stresses both the power and the danger that accrue to a person who violates such rules. Transgressive behavior has both a creative and a destructive aspect.</p></p><p>Leonard Muellner&#39;s goal is to restore the Greek word for the anger of Achilles, menis, to its social, mythical, and poetic contexts.

On the basis of the epic exemplifications of the word, Muellner defines the term as a cosmic sanction against behavior that violates the most basic rules of human society. Virtually absent from the Odyssey, the term menis appears in the Iliad in conjunction with the enforcement of social rules, especially the rules of reciprocal exchange. To understand the way menis functions, Muellner invokes the concept of tabu developed by Mary Douglas, stressing both the power and the danger that accrue to a person who violates such rules. Transgressive behavior has both a creative and a destructive aspect. Muellner draws on the method of mythical analysis developed by Pierre-Yves Jacopin. He applies the restructured definition of menis to the anger of Achilles in the narrative of the Iliad, tracing the moral issues that motivate cosmic anger and, finally, exploring the transformation of menis into the social term that is explicitly named as its opposite: philotes, or friendship.<p>Leonard Muellner is Professor of Classics at Brandeis University.

Though a number of these works refer in some degree to Ruscha's output of the past two decades, the period inaugurates two major series--the <i>Metro Plots</i>, which diagram streets in Los Angeles and American cities, and the celebrated <i>Mountain</i> paintings. A third series, loosely grouped, takes books as its subject. This period is also notable for the appearance of the first of the <i>Course of Empire</i> paintings, with which the artist would represent the United States at the 51st Venice Biennale in 2005.

To his dismay he finds there are young men destroying his hatch. As a Mennonite minister he believes in the way of peace, so instead of calling the authorities or shouting threats, Peter and his wife invite the young men in for a midnight meal. Their act of kindness brings unexpected results.</p><p>Peter is not alone in this collection of true stories. Each tells of returning love for hate, good for evil. Written for elementary age children (but of interest to teens and adults), Elizabeth H. Bauman shares 17 true stories of men and women from various times and countries who showed the universal power of Christian love.</p></p><p><b>&lt;p&gt;Elizabeth Hershberger Bauman (1924-1995), lived much of her life in Goshen, Indiana, where she was a mother of four children; school teacher; and active in her congregation. She and her husband, Harold E. Bauman, served in Ireland for two years in reconciliation work. &lt;i&gt;Coals of Fire&lt;/i&gt; was written at the request of the Mennonite Church in 1954 and has become a classic on Christian peacemaking and nonresistance.&lt;/p&gt;</b><p>"Bauman&#x2019;s <em>Coals of Fire</em> is a collection of stories of the actions of people from a number of branches of the Anabaptist family, based on their belief in justice, peace and nonviolence. In 5- to 10-page vignettes, Bauman tells of individual actions or decisions people have made at critical times. My favorite is the story of the Swiss family who wake up at night hearing someone taking the thatch off their house. The family invites the 'workers' in for a delicious meal, after which the 'workers' replace all of the thatch they had removed. This narrative echoes the pattern of showing forgiveness to persecutors demonstrated in the iconic <em>Martyrs&#x2019; Mirror</em> story of Dirk Willems, who turns back to rescue the man pursuing him across a frozen pond when he falls through the ice."</p><p><strong>--CMW Journal</strong></p> (<i>Endorsement</i>)</p><h2>Lord High Executioner: The Legendary Mafia Boss Albert Anastasia</h2><p><b>The bloodsoaked saga of the Murder, Inc. legend who helped create the modern American Mafia&#x2014;one body at a time&#x2014;featuring shocking eyewitness accounts . . .<br></b><br> Umberto &#x201c;Albert&#x201d; Anastasia was born in Italy at the turn of the century.

Many typefaces from the pre-digital past have been reinvented for use on computers and mobile devices, while other new font designs are revivals of letterforms, drawn from inscriptions, calligraphic manuals, posters, and book jackets. <i>Revival Type</i> deftly introduces these fonts, many of which are widely used, and engagingly tells their stories.<br><br> Examples include translations of letterforms not previously used as type, direct revivals of metal and wood typefaces, and looser interpretations of older fonts. Among these are variations on classic designs by John Baskerville, Giambattista Bodoni, William Caslon, Firmin Didot, Claude Garamont, Robert Granjon, and Nicolas Jenson, as well as typefaces inspired by less familiar designers, including Richard Austin, Philippe Grandjean, and Eudald Pradell. Updates and revisions of 20th-century classics such as Palatino, Meridien, DIN, Metro, and Neue Haas Grotesk (Helvetica) are also discussed.

This impressive debut from Stanley, the South African writing team of Michael Sears and Stanley Trollip, introduces overweight assistant superintendent David Bengu of the Botswana Police Department, whose nickname is, fittingly, Kubu (Setswanan for hippopotamus). In investigating the case of a partially consumed human body found in a remote area of a game reserve, Kubu keeps running across tangential links to Botswana Cattle and Mining, the country's largest company. As more people connected to the case turn up dead, Kubu realizes that multiple murder may be just the byproduct of a much more heinous crime. The intricate plotting, a grisly sense of realism and numerous topical motifs (the plight of the Kalahari Bushmen, diamond smuggling, poaching, the homogenization of African culture, etc.) make this a compulsively readable novel. Despite a shared setting with Alexander McCall Smith's No. 1 Ladies' Detective Agency series, this fast-paced forensic thriller will resonate more with fans of Patricia Cornwell's Kay Scarpetta. <i>(Apr.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Early in his career, he made deceptively simple sculptures of everyday objects--beginning with sinks and moving on to domestic furniture such as playpens, beds and doors. In the 1990s, his practice evolved from single works to theatrical room-sized environments. In all of his work, Gober's formal intelligence is never separate from a penetrating reading of the socio-political context of his time. His objects and installations are among the most psychologically charged artworks of the late twentieth century, reflecting the artist's sustained concerns with issues of social justice, freedom and tolerance. Published in conjunction with the first large-scale survey of the artist's career to take place in the United States, this publication presents his works in all media, including individual sculptures and immersive sculptural environments, as well as a distinctive selection of drawings, prints and photographs. Prepared in close collaboration with the artist, it traces the development of a remarkable body of work, highlighting themes and motifs that emerged in the early 1980s and continue to inform Gober's work today. An essay by Hilton Als is complemented by an in-depth chronology featuring a rich selection of images from the artist's archives, including never-before-published photographs of works in progress.<br><b>Robert Gober</b> was born in 1954 in Wallingford, Connecticut. He has had numerous one-person exhibitions, most notably at the Dia Center for the Arts, New York; The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles; and Schaulager, Basel. In 2001, he represented the United States at the 49th Venice Biennale. Gober's curatorial projects have been shown at The Institute of Contemporary Art, Boston; The Menil Collection, Houston; Hammer Museum, Los Angeles; and the Whitney Museum of American Art, New York.

(The Editors <i>Lambda Literary</i>)<br><br>What claims our attention is not so much Gober's quotidian subjects as the intentness with which he reconstitutes ordinary objects; this is his way of possessing them. Gober's laconic perfectionism lends humdrum stuff an eeriness. I feel that eeriness in teh subtle shadow play he reveals in his plainly carpentered cloest, in the delicacy of human hairs inserted into the wax surface of a sculpted leg, and in the trompe l'oeil finesse with which he paints the label on the battered Benjamin Moore can. Gober keeps his virtuosity tamped down adn under wraps. His weird world is constructed with teh meticulousness of a jeweler putting together a Faberge egg. (Jed Perl <i>The New York Review of Books</i>)<br><br>In the mid-1980's Robert Gober began to receive significant art-world attention for his sculptres of everyday domestic objects embedded with references to social justice, freedom adn tolerance.

The notebook contains his full confession&#x2014;he&#x2019;s waited 50 years to make it, and now it can&#x2019;t wait another day.

Pierre saved my life.&#x201d; Another wheeze. &#x201c;You understand why I did what I did.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besson capped his pen. The effort of talking had cost Monsieur Solomon, who was in his eighties, and he reached for his oxygen mask. After several labored inhales, he grabbed Besson&#x2019;s arm with a crab-claw grip. &#x201c;But Pierre&#x2019;s gone now,&#x201d; Solomon said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s all written in there: my confession, the amounts, dates. Years of entries.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besson reached across his desk to take the notebook from the old man&#x2019;s shaking hands. He opened the well-worn volume to see columns of names and numbers, an accountant&#x2019;s tiny, perfect handwriting. He turned page after page, his eyes catching on names and franc amounts as it gradually dawned on him what he must be looking at.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monsieur Solomon&#x2019;s rheumy brown eyes bored into the lawyer. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m dying. Get this to the right person.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besson reached for his briefcase. &#x201c;Tomorrow, first thing, I promise.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;<i>Non</i>, you must do it now.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A real pain, the old geezer.

You don&#x2019;t have to worry&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Now,&#x201d; Monsieur Solomon interrupted. &#x201c;This can&#x2019;t wait. I won&#x2019;t leave until you send a note to <i>la Procureure de la R�publique</i>.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old coot had barged into �ric Besson&#x2019;s office without an appointment&#x2014;as well as anyone could barge with an oxygen machine. &#x201c;My secretary&#x2019;s left already. I literally should be in court right now . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Monsieur Solomon pointed a knobby arthritic finger toward the adjoining room. &#x201c;Get that boy there, your helper. You trust him?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;He&#x2019;s family, but&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The old man stomped his shriveled leg. &#x201c;If you can&#x2019;t trust family, then who? Send him.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Another bout of wheezing.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Worried that the old man would be carried out of his office on a stretcher&#x2014;or worse, in a box&#x2014;Besson stepped into the adjoining office, where Marcus was assembling a new chair. Marcus was �ric&#x2019;s sister&#x2019;s boy, a gangling, baby-faced eighteen-year-old with curly hair and the beginnings of a beard.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Here&#x2019;s another job for you, Marcus,&#x201d; Besson said. &#x201c;I need you to run this to <i>la Proc</i>.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;But I&#x2019;ve got plans with Karine. A date.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besson reached in his pocket for a wad of francs. &#x201c;Do this, okay?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marcus glanced at his cell phone. &#x201c;How long will it take?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Back and forth in a taxi, twenty minutes, that&#x2019;s all.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besson shoved the old man&#x2019;s twine-bound notebook, its handwritten pages spilling out, into a plastic Monoprix shopping bag, knotted the plastic handles together, and zipped the sack into Marcus&#x2019;s backpack. &#x201c;Go right away.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t it be tomorrow?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Besson lowered his voice to a whisper. &#x201c;Please, it&#x2019;s important, Marcus.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Who is this old fart?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;A friend of my mother&#x2019;s. Long story.&#x201d; The door buzzer sounded. Besson&#x2019;s colleague had arrived to pick him up for court in Meudon. &#x201c;Marcus, just get this to <i>la Proc</i>. Tell her I sent you. Don&#x2019;t talk to anyone else. Don&#x2019;t meet anyone on the way except a taxi driver at the stand on the corner. <i>Comprends?</i>&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Marcus, perspiring, loosened his collar as he shut his uncle&#x2019;s door and scanned Boulevard Arago. In the humid afternoon, a woman walked her schnauzer; a car radio blared news into the velvet air. No taxi at the stand.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Et voil�, </i>Marcus would pocket the taxi fare and catch the bus. His uncle would never know. Marcus turned onto narrow rue Pascal and hurried through the dim tunnel created by the street that passed above it a block later. The tunnel echoed with his footsteps and with the rumbling of the cars passing overhead. The old notebook heavy in his backpack, he headed up the stairs to Boulevard de Port-Royal. Marcus was almost at the bus stop. He savored the thought of the money in his pocket.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; His cell phone vibrated. His uncle. He ignored it.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marcus scanned the sidewalk. Karine was standing near the bus stop and waved. Another call from his uncle. He ignored this one, too.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re late.&#x201d; A big pout on her red lips. He eyed her lace camisole top and hip-hugging jeans. &#x201c;My friend&#x2019;s letting us use her place, remember?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Marcus pulled her close. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re going to a hotel. No attic room with bedbugs in the mattress today.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine shook her head. &#x201c;On your allowance?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He glanced at the time. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got to take care of a quick job first.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine&#x2019;s mascaraed eyes gleamed. &#x201c;Why wait?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; What was the rush for the old fart&#x2014;would an hour matter?<br> &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right. Meet me at the hotel on Cinq Diamants. Let me stash this first.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> &nbsp;<br> Karine&#x2019;s perfume filled the hotel room. Marcus laughed as he came up from under the duvet damp with their sweat. His laugh was cut short as a huge male arm caught him in a choke hold from behind. He gasped for air, tried to grab at the arm around his neck, but his wrists were yanked behind him, then flex-cuffed so tight the plastic cut his flesh. He was dragged off the bed and dropped facedown on the carpet. <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The contents of his backpack rained down on his naked back. &#x201c;Where is it?&#x201d; a voice said.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Fear paralyzed him. He couldn&#x2019;t breathe.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A kick to his ribs. Then another. &#x201c;Where did you put it? Tell me or I&#x2019;ll keep it up.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t . . . know . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Of course you do. Where&#x2019;d you hide it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this over a stupid old notebook? But he couldn&#x2019;t fail his uncle. Maybe he could talk his way out of this, get this animal to untie him and then . . . what, jump out the window? What about Karine? &#x201c;Let me up . . . and I&#x2019;ll . . .&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He coughed into the beige rug, his mouth furred from inhaling the dust and pilling. The flex-cuffs, slick with his blood, bit into his wrists like wire.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Karine was screaming . . . or was that him?<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He couldn&#x2019;t see anything but beige and then the blindfold. His body was jerked up and slapped across the desk, the impact nearly snapping his spinal cord.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll ask again. Where is it?&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What do you want?&#x201d; Marcus asked.<br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Cut to the chase, kid.

Most students of history know that Martin Luther nailed his ninety-five theses to the Wittenberg Church door and that John Calvin penned the <em>Institutes of the Christian Religion.</em> However, the Reformation did not unfold in the straightforward, monolithic fashion some may think. It was, in fact, quite a messy affair. Using the most current Reformation scholarship, James R. Payton exposes, challenges and corrects some common misrepresentations of the Reformation. <em>Getting the Reformation Wrong:</em><ul><li>places the Reformation in the context of medieval and Renaissance reform efforts</li><li>analyzes conflicts among the Reformers</li><li>corrects common misunderstandings of what the Reformers meant by <em>sola fide</em> and <em>sola Scriptura</em></li><li>examines how the Anabaptist movement fits in with the magisterial Reformation</li><li>critiques the post-Reformational move to Protestant Scholasticism</li><li>explores how the fresh perspective on the Reformation could make a difference in today's churches</li></ul></p><p><strong>James R. Payton Jr.</strong> (Ph.D., University of Waterloo, Canada) is a professor of history at Redeemer University College in Ancaster, Ontario, and author of <em>Light from the Christian East</em> (InterVarsity Press)."Payton's corrections to the popular Reformation mythos is refreshing. Similarly refreshing is his acknowledgement of the modern Church's indebtedness to the early Church." (Douglas M. Beaumont, Christian Apologetics Journal, Fall 2011)<br><br>"The title is provocative, but what James R. Payton Jr. has in mind is not the overthrowing of generations of scholarship on the Reformation, but the use of the best scholarship to guide and correct misleading impressions often held by the common reader and Christian laypeople: for example, that the Reformation was a revolutionary bolt from the blue, that the principle of <em>sola scriptura</em> meant a wholesale rejection of Catholic theological tradition, that the Catholic Church was truculent over against the Protestant assault, refusing all efforts at reform, and the like. These notions are indeed false. On this basis of 'getting wrongs right,' the book proves to be a lively narrative that tells the story of the most important epoch in the history of the church in a clear, understandable, unfussy manner, yet one rich in detail. I appreciate especially Payton's sober conclusion on the tragic elements of what the sixteenth century wrought." (Walter Sundberg, professor of church history, Luther Seminary, St. Paul, Minnesota)<br><br>"Dr. Payton's new book, <em>Getting the Reformation Wrong,</em> is a refreshing and stimulating look at the events of the sixteenth century and their implications. He combines a solid understanding of the scholarship with a sensitivity to the faith issues involved, particularly for Christians of all types who may be reading these pages. Ending with reference to the worldwide Protestant missionary movement, he urges his readers to consider the tension between the triumph and the tragedy that are both the legacies of these long-ago events in a way that moves the discussion of the challenges of being a Protestant Christian right up to the present." (Helen Vreugdenhil, assistant professor of history, Redeemer University College)<br><br>"<em>Getting the Reformation Wrong</em> gets the Reformation right. All students of the Reformation, whether academic or just interested, must read this book. It rightly sets the record straight about the great people and ideas of the Protestant and Catholic Reformations of the sixteenth century in a refreshingly engaging style."

Kronos&#x2019;s army is stronger than ever, and with every god and half-blood he recruits, the evil Titan&#x2019;s power only grows. <br><br>While the Olympians struggle to contain the rampaging monster Typhon, Kronos begins his advance on New York City, where Mount Olympus stands virtually unguarded. Now it&#x2019;s up to Percy Jackson and an army of young demigods to stop the Lord of Time.<br> <br>In this momentous final book in the <i>New York Times</i> best-selling series, the long-awaited prophecy surrounding Percy&#x2019;s sixteenth birthday unfolds. And as the battle for Western civilization rages on the streets of Manhattan, Percy faces a terrifying suspicion that he may be fighting against his own fate.</p><p><b>Rick Riordan</b> is also the author of the previous books in the <i>New York Times</i> #1 best-selling series Percy Jackson and the Olympians<i>: Book One: The Lightning Thief</i>; <i>Book Two: The Sea of Monsters</i>; <i>Book Three: The Titan&#x2019;s Curse </i>and<i> Book 4: The Battle of the Labyrinth</i>.

The dyslexic, hyperactive teen takes on the curse of Achilles&#39;s heel, discovers newfound powers, visits the kingdom of Poseidon, and finds romance as a battle mounts against Kronos. With a touch of teenage geekiness to his voice, Jesse Bernstein is able to master Percy&#39;s sense of angst. While his voice is youthful, however, Bernstein lacks the speed and energy to allow listeners to completely suspend disbelief, and his tone lapses into a whining quality that some may find off-putting.

Writing down his experiences every day and reading his journal anew each morning gives him a poignantly tenuous hold on himself, but his story's hold on readers is powerful indeed. The two previous novels, combined in <i>Latro in the Mist</i> (<i>Soldier of the Mist</i> and <i>Soldier of Arete</i>) are generally considered classics of contemporary fantasy. Latro now finds himself in Egypt, a land of singing girls, of spiteful and conniving deities. Without his memory, he is unsure of everything, except for his desire to be free of the curse that causes him to forget.</p></p><p><p><b>Gene Wolfe (1931-2019)</b> was the Nebula Award-winning author of The Book of the New Sun tetralogy in the Solar Cycle, as well as the World Fantasy Award winners <i>The Shadow of the Torturer</i> and <i>Soldier of Sidon</i>.

I will try. I must read this every morning, too. Muslak will tell me. I must have Myt-ser&#x2019;eu tell me also. Let me begin with the first things I remember. <br>We left the ship and searched for an inn, ate and drank there, and slept in the same room. It was crowded and some of us returned to the ship to sleep, although I did not. <br>I woke when the others did, awakened, I think, by their footsteps. We ate again, and Muslak told me his name and that he is the captain of our ship. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re in Kemet, Lewqys, with a cargo of hides. This was where you wanted to go.&#x201d; <br>I said, &#x201c;I have been trying to remember my name. Thank you.&#x201d;<br>&#x201c;You couldn&#x2019;t remember it?&#x201d; <br>I shook my head. <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s bad. Your memory comes and goes. Now it seems like it&#x2019;s gone. Know why we&#x2019;re here?&#x201d; <br>I said, &#x201c;To sell the hides, I suppose.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;But what about you? Why are you here?&#x201d; <br>I had thought myself one of his ship&#x2019;s crew. Clearly I was not, so I shook my head again. <br>&#x201c;That settles it. I&#x2019;m taking you to a healer. They have the best healers in the world right here, and you&#x2019;re going to see one.&#x201d; He rose and motioned to me, and I followed him. <br>We spoke about healers with the innkeeper and set off for the House of Life, near which they are found. Here I should say that this bustling city is called Sais. <br>It is of great interest. First, because it seems so strange. Second, because I feel that I have seen such a place long ago. It is familiar, in other words, yet seems very foreign. <br>The houses of the poor are thatched mud huts, so small that most ofthe things other peoples do in their houses must be done outside. They have no windows. Only a few are painted. <br>The houses of richer folk are very different and are gaily painted, most often green, blue, or both. Some are of mud brick, though their paint deceived me until we had walked some distance. Some are wood. Some are of mud brick at the bottom, with wood higher up. All are surrounded by walls that prevented me from seeing what was in their courtyards. Often these walls are yellow or ocher, though a few are orange or red. At first I thought there were windows on the second level alone. Then I recalled the room in which we had slept, how high it was. I think these rooms are like that. The doors of the houses are small and low, the windows small and near the ceiling. It must be because the sun is so hot here. <br>Before I write of the healers, I should say that all these houses have flat roofs, and that some of the houses really are of two levels, both lofty. There are gardens on the flat roofs. I have seen many flowers there, and even some palms. These must be planted in tubs. There are also triangular sails, or perhaps tents, always two and always back-to-back. The sailcloth is as bright as the houses. I wanted to ask Muslak what they were, but was afraid he did not know and did not want to embarrass him. <br>The first healer we spoke with was a tall, lean man, as many men are here. <br>&#x201c;This fellow,&#x201d; Muslak said, indicating me, &#x201c;is a mercenary officer who has served the Great King. He&#x2019;s a good man and a fine fighter, but he cannot remember his name. Every morning we must tell him who he is and where he is, and why he is here.&#x201d; <br>The healer rubbed his jaw. &#x201c;Why is he?&#x201d; <br>(I should write that this was not said in my own tongue, in which I write it, but in the speech of Kemet, which Muslak knows much better than I.) <br>&#x201c;He saved me from slavery,&#x201d; Muslak explained. &#x201c;The price he asked was to be returned to his home in Luhitu.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You did as he wished?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I did, and the next time that we put in there I looked him up to see how he was doing. I hoped he had his memory back and would remember me. He was as bad as ever, but he had written &#x2018;Riverland&#x2019; above his door. I talked to his wife, and she said it was to tell him he must go there again to find out what had happened to him. I asked some other people what it meant, and it is their name for your country.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Ours is the Black Land,&#x201d; the first healer said. (Kemet is black in their speech.) <br>&#x201c;I know. But other people have other names for it. Anyway, I told him we would go there to trade, and he was welcome to sail with us if he wanted to. His wife wanted to come along, too. I told her it was impossible&#x2014;a ship has to have special arrangements for women, and we didn&#x2019;t have them. She said she would come anyway. <br>I told her she would be in a lot of danger. You understand.&#x201d; <br>The first healer nodded. <br>&#x201c;Somebody would lift her skirt, then kill her so she couldn&#x2019;t tell Lewqys. Because Lewqys would kill him sure. He&#x2019;s a terror with that crooked sword. When I was to be sold, they had two men guarding us, and he killed them both before they could draw breath.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;His wife is not with you?&#x201d; <br>Muslak shook his head. &#x201c;He came down to my ship in the harbor when we were nearly loaded, but he came alone. I think he must have written his law on her as soon as I left. But what&#x2019;s wrong with him? That&#x2019;s the point. Why can&#x2019;t he remember?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I was not merely inquisitive,&#x201d; the first healer explained. &#x201c;A wife often knows things a man&#x2019;s friends do not. I hoped to question her.&#x201d; <br>He clapped his hands. &#x201c;I want to consult a colleague of mine.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;You think we&#x2019;re all rich,&#x201d; Muslak said. &#x201c;Let me tell you that it isn&#x2019;t so, and until I can sell my cargo I&#x2019;ll have very little.&#x201d; <br>A boy came, and the first healer told him to bring Ra&#x2019;hotep. <br>While we waited, the first healer talked with me, asking my name. I gave it, and he asked how I knew it. I explained that Muslak had told me. <br>&#x201c;Would your wife call you so?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I did not remember that I had a wife until now.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;When we are born, we do not know how to talk. You remember how to talk, clearly.&#x201d; <br>I nodded. <br>&#x201c;Also how to use your sword, from what your friend says.&#x201d; <br>I said that I did not know whether I knew or not, but it seemed plain how such a sword must be used. <br>&#x201c;Just so. May I look at it?&#x201d; <br>I drew my sword and offered it to him hilt-first. <br>&#x201c;There is a word written here,&#x201d; he said, &#x201c;but it is not in the true Thoth-inspired writing. I cannot read it. Can you?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Falcata,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s the name of my sword.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;How do you know that?&#x201d; <br>I said I had read it on the blade this morning, which was a lie. <br>&#x201c;If he were in the grip of a xu, he would not have handed me his sword,&#x201d; the first healer told Muslak. (I think this word must mean daemonin their tongue.) &#x201c;Also, he speaks sensibly, and those who are in the grip of a xu never speak sensibly for long. Has he anything to gain by shamming?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Nothing,&#x201d; Muslak declared, &#x201c;and he couldn&#x2019;t have deceived me for more than a day. Besides, he pretends to remember sometimes. He wouldn&#x2019;t do that if he were faking.&#x201d; <br>The first healer smiled. &#x201c;So, Lewqys, you lie to us, do you?&#x201d; <br>I said, &#x201c;I suppose I do. All men lie at times, it seems to me.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;Oh, really? I would have said not. Who has lied to you recently?&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know.&#x201d; <br>While we spoke, the second healer entered. He greeted the first&nbsp; politely and took a stool. <br>&#x201c;This foreign man forgets everything,&#x201d; the first healer explained. &#x201c;His friend the ship-master has brought him to me. The disorder is of long standing.&#x201d; <br>Ra&#x2019;hotep nodded, not looking at the first healer but very intently at me. He is shorter than Muslak, and perhaps twenty years older. <br>Muslak said, &#x201c;Lewqys is a mercenary. He owns a farm in his own country. His relatives work it for him while he is away.&#x201d; <br>Ra&#x2019;hotep nodded again in the manner of one who had reached a decision. &#x201c;Was he like this when you met him for the first time?&#x201d; <br>Muslak shook his head. <br>&#x201c;Tell me of your first meeting.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;We were upriver. We&#x2019;d sold our cargo and were looking for&nbsp; something else&#x2014;papyrus at a good price, cotton cloth, or whatever. He had found out that the satrap had sent troops to the Great King, not his own troops from Parsa, but Nubians and your people. He had a hundred men and tried to get the satrap to hire them too. He wouldn&#x2019;t&#x2014;he&#x2019;d already sent the Great King what he&#x2019;d asked for. I told Lewqys he&#x2019;d have no trouble in Byblos&#x2014;that&#x2019;s my own city. They&#x2019;d be snapped up there, and good money. He said he&#x2019;d go, but he didn&#x2019;t have enough to hire my ship. He&#x2019;d have to march overland.&#x201d; <br>&#x201c;And did you, Latro?&#x201d; <br>He was clearly speaking to me. I asked if that was also my name. <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s the name I was given by your comrades when I saw you with the Great King&#x2019;s army. It took me a moment to recall it, but I&#x8;...</p><h2>Jefferson and Civil Liberties: The Darker Side</h2><p>In the most controversial analysis ever written of the apostle of American liberty, the distinguished constitutional historian Leonard W. Levy examines Jefferson's record on civil liberties and finds it strikingly wanting. Clearing away the saintliness that surrounds the hero, Mr. Levy tries to understand why the &#x201c;unfamiliar&#x201d; Jefferson supported loyalty oaths; countenanced internment camps for political suspects; drafted a bill of attainder; urged prosecutions for seditious libel; condoned military despotism; used the Army to enforce laws in time of peace; censored reading; chose professors for their political opinions; and endorsed the doctrine that means, however odious, are justified by ends. "Implicitly," Mr. Levy writes, "this book is a study of libertarian leadership in time of power and time of danger...Jefferson should be seen [by his biographers] as a whole man in the perspective of his times, but my task is to determine the validity of his historical reputation as the apostle of liberty."

Agrippa's view of divine order was subsequently eclipsed by the materialism and atheism of the Enlightenment, but 500 years later, his influential work endures as a cornerstone of mystic literature.<br>In serious, educated, and accessible terms, Agrippa defines occultism and magic as a natural means of attaining knowledge and power. His explanations of planetary rulerships, enchantments, sorceries, types of divination, and the interpretation of dreams offer an intriguing array of possibilities: improved health, prolonged life, increased wealth, and enhanced foresight. This inexpensive edition of his classic study offers students of the history of ideas and occult traditions an essential reference tool.</p><p>Cornelius Agrippa (1486&#x2013; 1535) was a German mystic and alchemist.

But when the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941 blasted the United States into World War II, 101 American Army and Navy nurses serving in the Philippines were suddenly treating wounded and dying soldiers while bombs exploded all around them. The women served in jerry-rigged jungle hospitals on the Bataan Peninsula and in underground tunnels on Corregidor Island. Later, when most of them were captured by the Japanese as prisoners of war, they suffered disease and near-starvation for three years. <i>Pure Grit</i> is a story of sisterhood and suffering, of tragedy and betrayal, of death and life. The women cared for one another, maintained discipline, and honored their vocation to nurse anyone in need&#x2014;all 101 coming home alive.<br>The book is illustrated with archival photographs and includes an index, glossary, and timeline.<br><br><b>Praise for <i>Pure Grit</i></b><br><b>STARRED REVIEW</b><br>"Details of many nurses&#x2019; individual trials combine to form a memorable portrayal of their shared experience, one which will emotionally impact readers."<br>--<i>Booklist</i>, starred review<br><br>"Primary source materials, especially the movingly matter-of-fact recollections of several of the nurses and personal snapshots, bring the story to life."<br>--<i>Kirkus Reviews</i><br><br>"Farrell doesn&#x2019;t spare her young readers any grim details . . .

She lives in Spokane, WA.Gr 7 Up&#x2014;This well-researched volume tells the story of the army and navy nurses who were stationed in the Philippines during World War II. The day after the attack on Pearl Harbor, the Japanese began bombing the Philippines. The 79 nurses serving there came from different backgrounds: some longed for an escape from farm life, while others sought adventure. All wanted to find meaningful work caring for others. During the bombardment, their subsequent retreat and, finally, their imprisonment by the Japanese, the nurses never stopped taking care of those around them. After months of near starvation, they were finally liberated by American forces in 1945. Yet even when the nurses arrived home, their troubles were not over. Many had difficulty readjusting to life at home; their experiences just didn't fit the paradigm of women's lives in the mid-20th century. As part of her research, Farrell interviewed the last surviving nurse, plus the children of many of the others, and the text is full of primary source documentation. This adds rich detail to make the circumstances all the more real, whether they are the injuries the nurses treated or the horrific conditions in the prison camps. In addition to photographs and helpful maps, the page layouts include facsimiles of the nurses' letters and diaries.

Yet few have known the full story of courage and human drama because no one has ever produced a lively and historically accurate account of the battle-until now. <i>Tempest at Ox Hill</i> compellingly evokes this pivotal battle of the war, in which the Union army faced annihilation after Robert E. Lee's overwhelming victory at Second Bull Run. At Chantilly, Virginia, on September 1, 1862, a small Union rearguard faced down some of Lee's best generals. The retreating main Union army, and Washington, were saved, but at a frightening human cost, including the deaths of two Union generals&#x2014;the promising Isaac Stevens and the dashing Philip Kearny, a Mexican War veteran who had also served with Napoleon III's imperial guard. And around these two Union generals lay nearly twelve hundred American soldiers, both blue and gray, dead fighting for their chosen cause. <i>Tempest at Ox Hill</i> captures the moment, the courage, and the carnage unforgettably.</p><p>David A.

In Kate's own words, the book is "a handy, inexpensive guide to healthful daily living." </p><p> Along with delicious recipes for appetizers, baked goods, canning, main dishes, salads, soups, and quick lunches and suppers, she provides a wealth of information on nutrition, "Notes to Brides", and helpful hints on cooking. Considered the "Martha Stewart" of her day, Kate Aitken's practical recipes endure to delight Canadian families today. </p></p><p><p> Born in Beeton, Ontario in 1891, Kate Scott learned the arts of homemaking and business from her parents. A born speaker and educator, she began teaching at only 14 years old. Shortly after her marriage in 1914 to her childhood sweetheart, Henry M. Aitken, Kate began a business canning and preserving the crops from their farm. Soon, residents and restaurants alike were clamouring for her products. As her reputation grew, she was invited by both provincial and federal Departments of Agriculture to lecture across the country. She also became the Director of Women's Activities for the Canadian National Exhibition, a position she held for 14 years. </p><p> Kate Aitken's journalistic career was wide and varied. She was a beauty editor for a large Canadian weekly, was the women' s editor for the <i>Montreal Standard</i>, and wrote pamphlets for leading food companies. Mrs. Aitken was on the radio three times a day, five days a week and audiences loved her no-nonsense recipes and down-to-earth advice. After retiring from broadcasting in 1957, Aitken by no means slowed down. She devoted her time to working for the United Nations, UNICEF, and as a member of the Board of Directors for the CBC. Her tireless work and seemingly limitless talent has left a legacy for all Canadians. </p><p> Elizabeth Driver is an editor and writer who has spent over twenty years researching the culinary history of Canada and Britain. She is fascinated by the history of food and an avid collector of cookbooks and antique kitchenware. Elizabeth lives with her husband and two children in Toronto, where she is the Foodways Program Officer at Mongomery's Inn museum. She demonstrates such historic techniques as cooking on an open hearth, returning home most days with the smell of wood smoke on her clothes. </p></p><h2>Deviant Desires: A Tour of the Erotic Edge</h2><p>Can there still be anything new to say about the erotic, sexy play, and desire?&nbsp;<br><br> <b>YES</b>, because what drives each of us to any sexual fixation&#x2014;from <b>feet </b>or <b>fat </b>to <b>latex </b>or <b>ponyplay</b>&#x2014;may hold mysteries, but can never be inexplicable.&nbsp;<br><br> <b>YES</b>, because even the most seemingly unusual kinks and fetishes, like <b>trample and crush</b>, <b>cannibal play</b>, <b>quicksand </b>and <b>male pregnancy</b>, derive from such universal themes as power and transformation.&nbsp;<br><br> <b>YES</b>, because when some <b>taboos </b>crumble, others emerge, with often surprising, delightful, and even disturbing consequences for our psyches and libidos.&nbsp;<br><br> <b>YES</b>, because as human culture evolves, we newly discover sexual excitement and fulfillment from scenarios (such as <b>car accidents</b>) and objects (like <b>gas masks </b>and <b>medical equipment</b>) that never existed before.&nbsp;<br><br> <b>YES</b>, because wherever there is darkness, secrecy, and silence, what&#x2019;s most essential is light, revelation, and ever better <b>communication</b>.</p><p>Yale-trained gonzo anthropologist <b>Katharine Gates </b>has now fully updated and revised her pioneering 2000 work, <i>Deviant Desires: Incredibly Strange Sex, </i>into what you now hold in your possibly trembling hands: DEVIANT DESIRES: A TOUR OF THE EROTIC EDGE&nbsp;<br> <b><br>And what a tour! </b>Within these pages Gates proves there&#x2019;s ALWAYS new information about sex and desire, because human adaptability and creativity ever combine to discover new frontiers of pleasure, whether by imagining ourselves <b>superheroes </b>or <b>tiny </b>or <b>giants</b>, or simply stuffing <b>party balloons </b>down our pants.&nbsp;<br><br> We might even find that what really accelerates our desires is <b>pumping car pedals</b>&#x2014;but only that specific, perfect way that gets us off like nothing else can.&nbsp;<br><br> Featuring over a thousand illustrations (mostly in color, new for this edition), interviews from around the world, both fun and serious discussion, and even some tips and suggestions, DEVIANT DESIRES: A TOUR OF THE EROTIC EDGE is for any adult who ever hoped or believed there might be more to life, love, and pleasure than previously imagined.&nbsp;<br><br> <i>&#x2014;David Steinhardt,&nbsp;</i><br> <i>Editor of this New Edition&nbsp;</i>"Beautifully illustrated with new images that are the perfect mix of the sexy, sensual, and subversive, <i>Deviant Desires</i> will satisfy your inquisitive mind with fascinating stories from the sexual fringe." <br>&#x2014;<b>HUCK&nbsp;<br><br></b><i>Deviant Desires</i>&nbsp;presents some of the most detailed information on kink&#x2019;s behind-the-scenes requirements that I&#x2019;ve encountered in a book not written explicitly as an instruction manual. &#x2014;<b>The Nation<br><br>AS SEEN IN: </b>BuzzFeed News</p><h2>The Webley Service Revolver (Weapon)</h2><p><p>The Webley .455in service revolver is among the most powerful top-break revolvers ever produced and has a claim to be the first 'tactical fighting pistol'. First adopted in 1887, in various marques it was the standard-issue service pistol for British and Commonwealth armed forces for nearly fifty years; later versions in .38in calibre went on to see further service in World War II and beyond, as well as in a host of law-enforcement roles around the world into the 1970s.<br>Developed to give British service personnel the ability to incapacitate their opponents in 'small wars' around the globe, the Webley used the formidable - and controversial - .455in cartridge, a variant of which was known as the 'manstopper'. Users found it offered good penetration and excellent stopping power with only mild recoil - indeed, it was rated superior to the US .45 Colt in stopping power.</p><p>Featuring specially commissioned full-colour artwork and close-up photographs, this is the compelling story of the Webley revolver, the powerful pistol that saw service across the British Empire and throughout two world wars.</p></p><p>Dr Robert Maze, a lifelong collector of 19th- and 20th-century British weaponry, has trained with US SWAT teams and has diplomas from defensive handgun courses.

This is his first book for Osprey.<p>&#x201c;Author Robert Maze tells us the sometimes convoluted story of the Webley Service Revolver from its inception to today's use. This includes all of the different variations and improvements made to the gun over its life time and has additional information on its use by the Irish Constabulary and the Shanghai Municipal Police.

In each scene, one species is highlighted with a paragraph or two of informational text, along with insets that indicate where the animal lives and some of its physical characteristics. Additional snippets of facts are found throughout the illustrations, giving further fascinating information about the featured species and some of the other creatures pictured. From the cover to the endpapers to each individual landscape, this title is visually arresting, offering lush colors and incredible detail. Although the animals are portrayed with realistic body shapes and colors, they have friendly, almost cartoonlike expressions on their faces. In most spreads, a small number of the animals have been anthropomorphized (using fishing poles, wearing hats), which, along with the conversational tone of the text, creates a fun, lighthearted mood&#x2014;even when dealing with topics such as hunting and survival.

In <i>Consumers' Imperium</i>, Kristin Hoganson reveals the other half of the story, demonstrating that the years between the Civil War and World War I were marked by heightened consumption of imports and strenuous efforts to appear cosmopolitan.<br><br>Hoganson finds evidence of international connections in quintessentially domestic places--American households. She shows that well-to-do white women in this era expressed intense interest in other cultures through imported household objects, fashion, cooking, entertaining, armchair travel clubs, and the immigrant gifts movement. From curtains to clothing, from around-the-world parties to arts and crafts of the homelands exhibits, Hoganson presents a new perspective on the United States in the world by shifting attention from exports to imports, from production to consumption, and from men to women. She makes it clear that globalization did not just happen beyond America's shores, as a result of American military might and industrial power, but that it happened at home, thanks to imports, immigrants, geographical knowledge, and consumer preferences.

But to Julia Taft, he was Tad Lincoln's father. Invited to the White House to watch over her two brothers, who were playmates of the Lincolns' sons, Julia had an intimate perspective on the First Family's home life, which she describes with charm and candor in this book. A rare look behind the public facade of the great man, Julia's affectionate account of the Lincolns at home is rich with examples of the humor and love that held the family together and that helped the President endure the pressures of governing a nation divided.&nbsp;Abraham and Mary Todd Lincoln often expressed their regret at not having a daughter of their own. Julia Taft thus enjoyed a special place in their lives, and her memoir reveals the warmth she elicited from the couple. She speaks of her initial fear of Lincoln&#x2014;the towering, rough-and-tumble backwoodsman&#x2014;who won her over with teasing, and of her relationship with Mary, who was never really accepted into Washington social life and took particular comfort in Julia's presence.&nbsp;A unique glimpse into the social life of the Lincoln White House, Julia Taft Bayne's memoir shows us the human drama played out daily behind the great pageant of history.</p><p>Mary A.

These poems see the roots of community in the family, and the roots of culture and government in the community.<br>Formally, the 71 poems in <i>Axe Handles</i> range from lyrics to riddles to narratives. The collection is divided into three parts, called "Loops," "Little Songs for Gaia," and "Nets," each containing poems of disciplined clarity. Gary Snyder knows well the great power of silence in a poem, silence that allows the mind space enough to discover the magic of song.</p><p>The title poem of this collection may be Snyder's strongest poem of the 1980s, and this is high praise. Incorporating Snyder's familiar and welcome themes of nature, family and eastern philosophy, it is a passage into a world of insights, small epiphanies, the rhythms of nature and culture, speech and sky, revealing themselves between these lines.

She&#x2019;ll be under your direction, and you will be responsible for her training.&#x201d;<br> <br>Max cut his gaze to the man seated across the table. His nerve endings prickled at the announcement, but he remained silent. He stretched out his legs under the conference table, crossed his arms in front of his chest, and quirked a brow. He&#x2019;d worked endless hours and sweat blood to get the family empire of La Dolce Maggie, the U.S. branch of Italian-based La Dolce Famiglia, off the ground, and damned if he&#x2019;d step aside nicely. &#x201c;Looking to replace me, boss?&#x201d;<br> <br>More like a brother than a boss, Michael Conte shot him a grin. &#x201c;And deal with your mama coming after me to kick my ass? No such luck. You need help with the expansion.&#x201d;<br> <br>Max smirked. &#x201c;Seems your mama is tougher than mine. Didn&#x2019;t she instigate a shotgun wedding with your wife? Good thing you loved her, or you would&#x2019;ve been screwed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Funny, Gray. The wedding wasn&#x2019;t the problem. It was your doubts about my wife that truly screwed us up.&#x201d;<br> <br>Max winced. &#x201c;Sorry. Just trying to protect a friend from a money-hungry woman. Anyway, I love Maggie now. She&#x2019;s strong enough to take your crap.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, now it&#x2019;s like a mutual admiration club between you two.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Better than war. So, who&#x2019;s the hotshot coming in?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Carina.&#x201d;<br> <br>Max snapped his mouth shut. &#x201c;Excuse me? Carina, your baby sister? You&#x2019;ve got to be kidding me&#x2014;isn&#x2019;t she still in school?&#x201d;<br> <br>Michael poured himself some water from the cooler and took a sip. &#x201c;She graduated last May with her MBA from SDA Bocconi, and she&#x2019;s been training at Dolce di Notte.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Our competitor?&#x201d;<br> <br>Michael smiled. &#x201c;Hardly. They are not looking to conquer the world like us, my friend. But I can trust them to teach her basic skills in the bakery business. I wanted her to train with Julietta but she refuses to lag in her older sister&#x2019;s shadow. She&#x2019;s been begging me to come to America and her internship is up. It is time she now join the family company. Capisce?&#x201d;<br> <br>Ah, hell. Yeah, he understood. Max was being reassigned to babysitting duty for the youngest sister of the clan. Sure, he loved her like a sibling, but her tendency to burst into tears over emotional scenes did not go well with business. Max shuddered. What if he hurt her feelings and she crumbled? This was a bad idea all around.<br> <br>&#x201c;Um, Michael, maybe you should put her in accounting. You always said she&#x2019;s capable with figures, and I don&#x2019;t think management is a good fit. I&#x2019;ve got a crazy schedule and I&#x2019;m in delicate negotiations. Please give her to someone else.&#x201d;<br> <br>His friend shook his head. &#x201c;Eventually, I will move her to CFO. But for now I want her with you. She needs to learn proper management and how La Dolce Maggie works. You&#x2019;re the only one I trust to make sure she doesn&#x2019;t get in trouble. You&#x2019;re family.&#x201d;<br> <br>The simple words slammed the last nail into his vampire home. Family. Michael had always taken care of him, and he&#x2019;d proven himself worthy. He&#x2019;d also dreamed of a place carved out just for him. The peak of the food chain, so to speak. No one had ever questioned his job as CEO, but lately he wondered if missing the prized Conte blood in his veins hurt his position. Contracts were temporary, and his was renegotiated every three years. He craved a more permanent place in the empire he helped build, and the expansion of three more bakeries could be his crown jewels. If he did his job well, he&#x2019;d secure himself at the top, right beside Michael&#x2014;as a permanent partner instead of an appointed CEO. Worrying about a young girl fresh from business school would only distract him. Unless . . .<br> <br>He tapped his finger against his lower lip. Perhaps Michael needed to be reminded of how critical his efforts were for the company. By throwing Carina certain challenges, he&#x2019;d be sure to highlight her deficiencies and young age, all the while keeping her under his so-called protection. After the expansion, Max intended to approach Michael about partnership. Carina may be able to help his cause, especially if he mentored her and she depended on his feedback.<br> <br>Yes, perhaps this was for the best.<br> <br>&#x201c;Okay, Michael, if this is what you want.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Good. She&#x2019;ll be arriving in about an hour. Why don&#x2019;t you come to dinner tonight? We&#x2019;re having a small welcome celebration for her arrival.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Is Maggie cooking?&#x201d;<br> <br>Michael grinned. &#x201c;Hell, no.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then I&#x2019;m in.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Smart man.&#x201d; Michael crushed the paper cup, threw it in the trash, and closed the door behind him.<br> <br>Max glanced at his watch. He had a ton of work to accomplish before she arrived.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>Carina stared at the sleek wooden door with the shiny gold sign. She swallowed past the tightness in her throat and swiped her damp palms down her black skirt. This was ridiculous. She was grown up and well past the days of mooning over Max Gray.<br> <br>After all, three years was a long time.<br> <br>She smoothed back a strand of hair from her sleek topknot, straightened her shoulders, and knocked on the door.<br> <br>&#x201c;Come in.&#x201d;<br> <br>The sound of his husky voice drifted past her memory and grabbed her in a choke hold. It was rich and creamy smooth, hinting at naughty sex and mischief that only a nun could ignore. Maybe.<br> <br>She opened the door and strode in with fake confidence. Carina knew it didn&#x2019;t matter. The business world only observed what lay upon the surface. The knowledge soothed her&#x2014;she had gotten very good at hiding her emotions during her training. It was simply a matter of survival.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello, Max.&#x201d;<br> <br>The man behind the sprawling teak desk gazed at her with a strange mixture of warmth and surprise, almost as if he wasn&#x2019;t expecting the woman who stood before him. Those piercing blue eyes sharpened and roved over her figure before his face smoothed out to a polite welcome. Her heart teetered, dropped, and held steady. For one moment, she allowed herself to drink in his appearance.<br> <br>His body was lean and trim, and his impressive height always added an intimidating demeanor that was an edge with most of his deals. His face reflected the image of a demon and angel caught in a love affair. Sharp cheekbones, an elegant nose, and a graceful curved brow held hints of aristocracy. The sexy goatee hugged his jaw, accented the plump curve to his lips, and bespoke pure sex. Thick, coal black hair fell in untamed waves across his forehead and set off the rocketing blue of his eyes. As he moved toward her, he walked with an easy grace a tall man usually didn&#x2019;t pull off, and the enticing scent of his cologne teased her senses. The odd combination of wood, spice, and lemon made her want to bury her face in the curve of his neck and breathe in.<br> <br>Of course, she didn&#x2019;t. Not even when he held her briefly in a welcome hug. Her fingers rested over broad shoulders barely contained in his custom-made navy suit. She&#x2019;d long ago faced her own personal kryptonite and learned core lessons. Acknowledge her weakness. Accept it. Move on. The simple rules in business applied to all areas of her life now.<br> <br>She smiled up at him. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s been a long time.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Too long, cara.&#x201d; Unease flashed in his eyes, then disappeared. &#x201c;I heard you graduated at the top of your class. Well done.&#x201d;<br> <br>She gave a brief nod. &#x201c;Thank you. And you? Michael says you&#x2019;re working hard on expanding La Dolce Maggie.&#x201d;<br> <br>His jaw clenched. &#x201c;Yes. It seems you will be assisting me in this aspect. Have you spoken with your brother yet?&#x201d;<br> <br>Carina frowned. &#x201c;No, I came straight to headquarters so I could put in a few hours first. I figured he&#x2019;d give me the tour. What division is he starting me with? Accounts payable, budgeting, or operations?&#x201d;<br> <br>He studied her face for a while, his gaze an actual caress as he probed every feature. She held tight and submitted to the inspection. She needed to get used to his presence since she&#x2019;d be bumping into him at work. Thank God she&#x2019;d be buried in accounting. Her core concentration and skills with figures were solid, and Max would rarely need to peek in on her progress.<br> <br>A smile curved those sensual lips and briefly distracted her. &#x201c;Me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Excuse me?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Your division. You&#x2019;ll be working with me as my assistant. I&#x2019;ll be training you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Horror flooded her. She took a step back as if he was the demon who requested she sign away her soul. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think that&#x2019;s a good idea.&#x201d; A crazy laugh escaped her lips. &#x201c;I mean, I don&#x2019;t want to get in the way. I&#x2019;ll speak with Michael and convince him to start me somewhere else.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you not want to work with me?&#x201d; He lifted his hands. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing to worry about, Carina. I will take good care of you.&#x201d;<br> <br>An image of him slipping his fingers in her damp heat and stroking her to orgasm blazed before her vision. God knew he&#x2019;d take care of a woman. In all ways. Color flooded her cheeks so she turned quickly as if studying his office. Ridiculous. She was losing her control within five minutes of their first meeting.<br> <br>Her heels clicked on the wooden tile as she paced and feigned interest in the large photo of the waterfront opening. This was her ultimate test, and she refused to fail. Max was a silly crush from her youth, and she&#x2019;d no longer live her life in an emotional prison. She&#x2019;d come here for two main reasons: Prove her worth, and exorcise the ghost of Maximus Gray.<br> <br>Failure so far on both accounts.<br> <br>She cleared her throat and faced him once again. &#x201c;I appreciate your willingness to train me,&#x201d; she said pleasantly, &#x201c;but I&#x2019;d feel more comfortable elsewhere.&#x201d;<br> <br>His lip quirked. &#x201c;Suit yourself. But I think your brother has a clear idea of what he wants. Why don&#x2019;t I give you a brief tour while I ring him? I don&#x2019;t think he expected you until later.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine.&#x201d; She lifted her chin in challenge. &#x201c;Perhaps it&#x2019;s time to remind my brother he is no longer in charge of me.&#x201d;<br> <br>Carina made sure to lead the way out.<br> <br>� � �<br> <br>What the hell was going on?<br> <br>Max trotted obediently after the cool, poised woman in front of him and tried to gather his wits. This was not the young girl he&#x2019;d last seen in Italy, who was emotional, dramatic&#x2014;self-conscious.<br> <br>No, this Carina Conte had grown up. He used to get a kick out of her admiring gaze and shy habit of ducking her head when something embarrassed her. Carina was used to listening to the demands of others. She was a people pleaser, extra sensitive, and a lovely girl he&#x2019;d always felt quite overprotective about. But the woman he&#x2019;d met this time seemed completely in control and capable. The idea of her standing up to her older brother shocked him. He wondered at the quick stab of disappointment in the changes, then shrugged it off. Maybe she&#x2019;d end up being more of an asset to the company than he&#x2019;d originally thought.<br> <br>Of course, her body had bloomed, too. Or had he just never noticed? Max ripped his gaze away from the full curve of her rear as she swung her hips in the ancient rhythm created to drive men mad. Shorter than her older sisters, she teetered on four-inch heels that showed off the muscled length of her legs. As he introduced her to various employees and they made their way around the ground floor, he noticed that she&#x2019;d grown in other ways, also. Especially in her cleavage.<br> <br>Heat rushed through him and squeezed. The delicate white blouse opened at the neck and revealed a touch of lace. Her full breasts strained against the material as if dying to escape, turning her respectable business suit into a vehicle for a stripper. Horrified at the sudden veer of his thoughts, he quickly imagined nuns in underwear and got himself back in control.<br> <br>Carina was off-limits. He was her guardian and second protector. Max shook his head and studied her face in an almost academic light. She&#x2019;d always been a pretty girl, but usually slapped on so much makeup he couldn&#x2019;t really see her features. Today, scarlet red lips were her only accessory. The olive tint to her skin gleamed under the light and tempted a man to touch. Those untamed curls had disappeared into a severe topknot that set off heavy brows and high cheekbones. Her nose was all Italian, and dominated her face, but the power of those stormy dark eyes held a person captive and refused to let go. She&#x2019;d never be rail thin, and he wondered why most women wanted to be. The lush curves that strained against her straight-edged suit was all temptress.<br> <br>Did she have a lover?<br> <br>Crap, where did that thought come from? He rubbed his eyes and half groaned with relief at the sight of Michael down the hallway.<br> <br>Her brother threw his arms out in the ancient family tradition, but Carina didn&#x2019;t rush into his embrace. Instead, she smiled, walked slowly down the hall, and hugged him back. The strength of their bond shimmered around them, and once again Max experienced a pang of loneliness. He always craved a sibling to share his life with. At least, Michael and his sisters were his adopted family. But after Max&#x2019;s father took off, only one goal remained and kept him on the path to revenge: success.<br> <br>So don&#x2019;t screw it up.<br> <br>He nodded to the inner voice and refocused. Michael flung his arm around Carina&#x2019;s shoulder and walked over. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m so happy you are finally here, mia bella. I told my driver to take you directly to the house, though. Maggie has been waiting for you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Carina tilted her head up and grinned. &#x201c;And how is my sister-in-law doing?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Cranky.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Do you blame her?&#x201d; She laughed. &#x201c;I told your driver there was a change in plans. I figured I&#x2019;d grab a tour, set up my desk, and head to your house. Max gave me a brief overview of the layout.&#x201d;<br> <br>Michael clapped him on the back and turned to Carina. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re in good hands. Why don&#x2019;t you take the office next to his? It&#x2019;s been empty for a while, and I can get the boxes cleared out today. We&#x2019;ll hold a strategy meeting tomorrow on some new developments.&#x201d;<br> <br>An uncomfortable silence settled around them. Michael looked confused at the sight of his sister&#x2019;s stony expression. &#x201c;Yes, it seems we need to lay out some ground rules first. Can we meet in your office?&#x201d;<br> <br>Max nodded. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll leave you two and catch up tonight.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No, Max. I&#x2019;d like you to join us,&#x201d; Carina said.<br> <br>Her direct gaze caused an odd sensation to prickle his skin, but he ignored it. He assented and they convened in Michael&#x2019;s office. The chairs were deep and comfortable, made for long hours of conferences. He fought a chuckle when her petite frame got swallowed by the plush velvet, and she inched her rear to the edge of the seat. She tossed him a disgusted glance that told him his amusement had been caught, and primly closed her legs, heels placed firmly on the floor. Those well-defined calves were made for gripping a man&#x2019;s hips as he thrust inside her.<br> <br>Jesus, get a grip. He was an old man at thirty-four. Sure, the hot librarian look was a shock, but Carina was still like family and years younger. Sheltered. Innocent. She&#x2019;d probably die of embarrassment if she suspected her appearance rocked his world . . . and parts of his anatomy.<br> <br>He quickly dispersed the image.<br> <br>&#x201c;Michael, I have some concerns about my place here. Maybe you can let me know what you see as my role, and we can make the necessary adjustments.&#x201d;<br> <br>Her brother drew back. Seems like he wasn&#x2019;t the only one surprised by the rational Carina Conte. &#x201c;You should not worry about this, cara.

The name &#x2018;Tarot&#x2019; is believed to be a reference to the Ancient Egyptian &#x2018;Book of Thoth&#x2019; and have connections to Isis, one of the oldest goddesses present within the ancient culture. Tarot decks were traditionally used throughout Europe as simple playing cards and only became essential tools of Divination in the early 1500s. The earliest recorded use of Tarot cards as tools of Divination is present within the book &#x2018;The Oracles of Francesco Marcolino da Foril,&#x2019; which dates back to 1540. <br> <br> Tarot Cards &#x2013; What are they? <br> Tarot Cards are pictorial representations and architypes of events, energies and emotions we are likely to encounter throughout our lives. Tarot Cards can indicate determination, financial success, patience, new beginnings, joy, togetherness, loss, reflection, heartache and many other important ideals. The Tarot can help us to known ourselves more intimately and to understand why things happen to us. The Tarot acts as a mirroring of our own personal philosophy and psychology due to the fact that a card&#x2019;s meaning can only be unlocked by an individual&#x2019;s perception. A Tarot deck normally includes 78 cards: 22 Major Arcana cards and 56 Minor Arcana cards.</p><p></p><h2>D&#39;Aulaires&#39; Book of Greek Myths</h2><p><p><b>Read by Paul Newman, Sidney Poitier, Kathleen Turner, and Matthew Broderick</b><br><br>Here are the immortals of Olympus&#x2014;the gods and goddesses of ancient Greece&#x2014;as freshly described as if they were alive today.<br><br>Mighty Zeus with his fistful of thunderbolts; mischievous little Hermes; grey-eyed Athena, godess of wisdom; Asclepius, the first physician; Orpheus and his beloved Euridice; Helios the sun, crossing the heavens in his fiery chariot. . . these and other equally fabulous figures are featured here with their heroic deeds and petty squabbles illuminated in full dimension.</p></p><p>No education is complete without a large slice of Greek mythology. And there's no better way of meeting that literary quota than with the D'Aulaires' book. All the great gods and goddesses of ancient Greece are depicted in this big, beautiful classic, lovingly illustrated and skillfully told. Young readers will be dazzled by mighty Zeus, lord of the universe; stirred by elegant Athena, goddess of wisdom; intimidated by powerful Hera, queen of Olympus; and chilled by moody Poseidon, ruler of the sea. These often impetuous immortals flounce and frolic, get indiscreet, and get even. From petty squabbles to heroic deeds, their actions cover the range of godly--and mortal--personalities.<p> The D'Aulaires' illustrations have a memorable quality: once pored over, they will never leave the minds of the viewer. Decades later, the name Gaea will still evoke the soft green picture of lovely Mother Earth, her body hills and valleys and her eyes blue lakes reflecting the stars of her husband, Uranus the sky. No child is too young to appreciate the myths that have built the foundation for much of the world's art and literature over the centuries. This introduction to mythology is a treasure.

Falco traces these legends of Reconstruction-era Memphis to an equally brutal twentieth century underworld &#x2015; Beale Street kingpin Jim Canaan, Edward Crump's political machine, the Dixie Mafia, and others. Also included are revelatory dialogues concerning the city's many music legends, from rockabilly icons Elvis Presley, Jerry Lee Lewis and Charlie Feathers to more underground figures such as Jim Dickinson and country blues wailer Jessie Mae Hemphill. Interwoven with these accounts is an autobiographical history of Falco's own time in Memphis, including his involvement with performance art ensemble Insect Trust, working with pop/rock maverick Alex Chilton, and the formation of his seminal rock and roll band, Panther Burns.

As a post mortem to the 60s, I pulled the green '50 Ford up to the side screen-door of the decrepit cabin at dawn, opened all its doors and lids and stuffed in junk, old clothes, pots and pans, and art supplies. Just enough room left to squeeze in behind the steering wheel and to work the 4-speed shifter bolted in the floorboard. My partner cranked the starter motor and cast off from the old cabin inherited now by denizens of spiders, snakes, and rodents already snugly at home within its planks and clapboard walls, cozy in the morning chill and warmed by the final embers glowing in the belly of the rustediron woodstove.<br><br> The rumble of the twin smitty exhaust pipes sounded muffled as the blue-dot taillights retreated down the gravel road strewn between the ruts with pine needles brown and fragrant. I followed behind on a black and silver Norton motorbike. We hit the main road and by the time we crested Gaylor Mountain &#x2015; the highest peak on the Arkansas side of the Ozarks &#x2015; the '48 Mercury flathead motor underneath the hood of the old Ford had come alive breathing the thin, rarefied air through 3-deuces sitting atop Offenhauser intake manifolds. The Norton was flying down the curves swooping past Devil&#x2019;s Den on the right and descending into the foothills of the mountain range that begins at Alma, then around and beyond Fort Smith heading east. By the time the Arkansas River came in sight a reedy, hollow sound was coming out of one exhaust pipe of the Norton. Oil had started pumping out of the left bank of the motor passing a fine but fierce spray from under the head gasket out into the crisp, turbulent air. Running on one cylinder, the engine speed had tapered off to 2700 rpm providing a maximum forward thrust of not more than 40 mph. At Alma the green Ford had already shot by me at 90 mph. The only solution was to stop and add more oil to the tank and then pull in behind a high balling semi-tractor trailer truck and ride in the back draft of its air stream. The drag of the semi pulled me all the way across the Arkansas delta and up Crowley's Ridge, then on to Memphis. Motor oil had now soaked through the sleeve of my motorcycle jacket, penetrated my left engineer boot, and completely drenched the rear wheel of the motorbike, which remained in a constant state of controlled skid. Yet this would not be my first foray into Memphis, nor would it be my last....<br><br>Volume Two is due in 2012</p><h2>Revolution: The Great Crisis of the British Monarchy, 1685-1720</h2><p>To an extraordinary extent, everyone in Britain still lives under the shadow of the "Glorious Revolution" of 1688. It was a massive, brutal, and terrifying event, which completely changed the governments of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and which was only achieved through overwhelming violence. <i>Revolution </i>brilliantly captures the sense that this was a great turning point in Britain's history, but also shows how severe a price was paid to achieve this.</p><p><b>Tim Harris </b>is Professor of History at Brown University.

Hunt, Commander Of Artillery, Army Of The Potomac</h2><p>The deadly accurate guns of the Union artillery were the most feared weapons on Civil War battlefields. General Henry Jackson Hunt, the highest-ranking artillery officer in the Union army, was &#34;the man behind the guns&#34;-the military genius who transformed a disorganized artillery corps into the most effective service arm of the army. Even the Confederates admired General Hunt. One Rebel general once boasted, &#34;Give me Confederate infantry and Union artillery, and I&#39;ll whip the world!&#34;The Man Behind the Guns tells the life story of General Hunt, who, by the time he died in 1889, was recognized as one of the finest tacticians and military theorists ever to wear an American uniform. His outstanding reputation, however, had been established years before when his 270 strategically placed cannon shattered Pickett&#39;s Charge and decided the outcome of the most significant battle in American history.This classic military biography, published twenty-five years ago and now available for the first time in paperback, is a &#34;must&#34; for every student of Civil War history.</p><p><b>Edward G.

"Cirrus," "cumulus," and "stratus" now seem almost self-evident descriptions, but when Howard gave his epochal lecture at London's Askesian Society in 1802, the bewildering variety of clouds was more obvious than anything else. Howard's great achievement, writes Hamblyn with characteristic elegance, was "the penetrating insight that clouds have many individual shapes but few basic forms." His graceful r�sum� of meteorology from the time of the ancient Chinese shows just how difficult generations of scientists found it to make sense of clouds, which frequently served as a metaphor for the awesome complexity of the natural world. Hamblyn's marvelous portrait of English cultural life at the turn of the 19th century reminds us how enthralled the general public was by scientific lectures and demonstrations, which served as a form of popular entertainment as well as a valuable tool in the dissemination of knowledge. "People cheered at lectures," he notes, and young men like Howard, a pharmacist by trade, "refused to allow the circumstances in which they found themselves to deflect them from [a] heroic sense of destiny." This was the great age of amateur scientists, many of them Dissenters like Howard whose religious unorthodoxy barred them from government service and aristocratic clubs. They forged their own place in England's burgeoning industries and in the scientific revolution unleashed by Isaac Newton. Howard, a devoted husband and father active in educational work and the antislavery movement, was representative of the remarkable autodidacts who reshaped European culture.

The chance to bring together some of my favorite writers, in my adopted hometown (in every place I bartended, the cook or the manager carried a .38 in his waistband, and I can still make ten kinds of boilermakers), was a joy and a privilege. Every single story is a noir gem...If you are an optimist, noir may be an antidote, a crisp, dry balance for your sunny outlook. If you are a pessimist (or, as we say, a realist), noir is your home ground, your tribe. It's not just that you expect ants to come to the picnic; you know damned well that there will be ants at the picnic. When they come, you're relieved. When they crawl up your brother's leg, you're reassured and possibly delighted. But the other side of noir is the moral center. The center may be shabby, frayed, and in serious need of a facelift, but it is a center. It's not necessarily heroic. It's likely to be cynical, and its resilience is not the showy kind. Mean streets, as Raymond Chandler once said, not but mean.</em></p><p><em>That's New Haven.</em></p></p><p>Amy Bloom is the author of three novels, three collections of short stories, a children&#x2019;s book and a collection of essays.

In addition to the everyday issues of being a student athlete, <i>The Rebounders</i> also covers the objectification of female athletes, race, sexuality, and self-expression.<br><br> Most college athletes, famous or not, play hard, get hurt, fail, and triumph together in a profound love of their sport and one another, and then their careers end and they figure out how to move on.

His eyes widened as he gazed down on the crazed activity below.<br><br>&#x201c;This is Earth,&#x201d; Mercy informed their young charge with a tinge of pride. For all its problems, Earth was a fascinating place to visit with the tall buildings that butted up against the sky and people milling about with such purpose, most of them unaware of the spiritual world that surrounded them. More times than she could remember Mercy had lost patience with humans. Those who were considered the apex of God&#x2019;s creations appeared to be slow-�witted and spiritually dull. Yet she loved them and treasured her Earthly assignments.<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s New York,&#x201d; Shirley added, resting her chin in her hands as she gazed longingly below. &#x201c;Oh, I do so love this city.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Manhattan, to be more precise,&#x201d; Goodness clarified and ended with a little sigh, indicating that she, too, had missed visiting Earth.<br><br>The four hovered near Times Square, watching the clamoring crowds jockeying for space on New Year&#x2019;s Eve.<br><br>Will&#x2019;s eyes widened as he intently studied the scene taking place in the streets below. &#x201c;Is it always like this&#x2014;�so busy and crowded, I mean?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;No, no, this is a special night. The people are gathering together to usher in the New Year.&#x201d; Time was a concept reserved for Earth. In heaven it was much different. Consequently, the time restriction placed on the three Prayer Ambassadors when given Earthly assignments had caused more than one problem.<br><br>&#x201c;Did Gabriel want us&#x2014;�&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Gabriel,&#x201d; Shirley gasped, and quickly cut him off. &#x201c;He doesn&#x2019;t exactly know that we&#x2019;ve brought you here. It would probably be best if you didn&#x2019;t mention this short visit to him, okay?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Yes, please, it would be best not to let anyone know we&#x2019;ve shown you Earth.&#x201d; It went without saying they&#x2019;d be in all kinds of trouble if Gabriel learned what they&#x2019;d been up to.<br><br>&#x201c;Gabriel means well but he tends to get a little prickly about these things,&#x201d; Goodness explained to their young charge.<br><br>&#x201c;Why is that?&#x201d; Will stared at all three of them.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, you see, we . . . the three of us . . . thought we should give you a bird&#x2019;s-�eye view of Earth and these people God loves so much&#x2014;�strictly for training purposes.&#x201d; Mercy looked to her friends to expound upon their intentions, which were honorable if not a tad bit sneaky.<br><br>This Earthly visitation had been a spur-�of-�the-�moment decision. Mercy had been the one to suggest it. Naturally, Goodness was quick to agree, and after some discussion Shirley had seen the light as well.<br><br>Will, an apprentice angel, had been placed under their charge, and given this honor, it was only right that he get a glimpse of the trials and tribulations that awaited him once he started working as a Prayer Ambassador. The job could be a bit tricky, and the more Will understood the idiosyncrasies of humans, the better he would do once given an assignment from Gabriel.<br><br>Mercy was certain that under their tutorship, Will would make a fine Prayer Ambassador one day. He was young and enthusiastic, eager to learn about Earth and the role he would play.<br><br>As Mercy, who had falsely been labeled a troublemaker, had pointed out, theirs was a duty that required serious dedication. She wasn&#x2019;t alone in believing this. Goodness&#x2014;�oh, poor Goodness&#x2014;�had gotten something of a reputation, too, and Mercy felt partially to blame, but that was another story entirely. Shirley tended to be a bit more on the straight-�and-�narrow path and had worked hard to reform her friends. In fact, Shirley, a former Guardian Angel, had done such a marvelous job, Gabriel had offered to let them train the promising young angel who was with them now.<br><br>Naturally, it was understood that if the three of them accepted this assignment training Will, then of course there would be no hanky-�panky, no tricks, no nothing. All three had agreed. This was a high honor indeed and their intentions were good.<br><br>Now here they were, New Year&#x2019;s Eve in Times Square, in one of the most amazing cities on Earth. Mercy breathed in deeply, savoring the moment. Bringing Will had been a good excuse, but the fact of the matter was that she had missed visiting Earth. It&#x2019;d been a good long while since their last assignment, and she missed the razzle-�dazzle of the big city.<br><br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t Earth just marvelous?&#x201d; Goodness said, her huge wings fluttering with delight. &#x201c;Just look at all those neon lights. I&#x2019;ve always been especially fond of light.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;As we all are,&#x201d; Shirley reminded them.<br><br>&#x201c;Can we go down there with the people?&#x201d; Will asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Absolutely not.&#x201d; Shirley&#x2019;s loud protest was instantaneous.<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t think it would hurt anything,&#x201d; Goodness countered, her gaze still fixed on the bright lights of the city below.<br><br>Will glanced from one to the other.<br><br>&#x201c;How will he ever learn about humans if he doesn&#x2019;t have the opportunity to mingle with them?&#x201d; Mercy asked, siding with her dearest friend. Shirley could be such a stickler for rules. Okay, so they&#x2019;d originally promised not to get anywhere close to humans, but this would be a good teaching moment for Will.<br><br>&#x201c;How will he ever learn how to work as a Prayer Ambassador if he doesn&#x2019;t become familiar with humans?&#x201d; Goodness protested.<br><br>Shirley wavered. While she might be opinionated on a number of topics, she could be easily swayed, which was the best part of working with her, Mercy felt.<br><br>&#x201c;Well . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do we hear the humans&#x2019; prayers?&#x201d; Will asked.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, no,&#x201d; Shirley explained. &#x201c;Only God hears their prayers, and then He talks matters over with Gabriel and then . . .&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Then Gabriel passes along those requests to us.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;And we assist in answering them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One of our roles is to help humans realize how much they can do for themselves with God&#x2019;s help,&#x201d; Goodness clarified.<br><br>&#x201c;We try as best we can without interfering in their lives,&#x201d; Shirley added quickly, glaring at Goodness and Mercy.<br><br>This was a warning and Mercy recognized it the instant her friend spoke.<br><br>&#x201c;But first, and this is the most important part,&#x201d; Goodness emphasized, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s our duty to teach these humans a lesson. Then and only then are we able to help them with their troubles.<br><br>&#x201c;The real difficulty comes when they don&#x2019;t want to learn.&#x201d; Goodness shook her head because this aspect of the job was often a challenge. &#x201c;Some people seem to want God to step in and do as they ask without making a single contribution to the effort.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It doesn&#x2019;t work like that,&#x201d; Mercy said, although she&#x2019;d done a fair bit of finagling to help these poor witless souls. In theory, answering prayers didn&#x2019;t sound the least bit difficult. Unfortunately, humans were sometimes completely dense.<br><br>&#x201c;They can be so stubborn,&#x201d; Goodness said, shaking her head again.<br><br>&#x201c;Strong willed,&#x201d; Shirley agreed.<br><br>&#x201c;Oh, yes, and once&#x2014;�&#x201d; Mercy snapped her mouth closed. It was best not to reveal their past antics for fear it would mislead their young charge into thinking that perhaps he should follow in their footsteps. Gabriel would take exception to that.<br><br>&#x201c;Once?&#x201d; Will pressed. &#x201c;What happened?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Never mind,&#x201d; Shirley said, reading the situation perfectly. &#x201c;Some things are best laid to rest and not discussed.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Can I go down and be with the crowd?&#x201d; Will asked again. &#x201c;I won&#x2019;t say anything to Gabriel.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;He isn&#x2019;t the only one,&#x201d; Shirley blurted out. &#x201c;I mean, we shouldn&#x2019;t mutter a word of this to anyone in heaven.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Rules II</h2><p>Sequel to the bestseller The Rules.</p><p>In February of 1995 The Rules was quietly published - and dating has never been the same since!

How much money did one need to own a house in the Swiss Alps? Enough that she was quickly recalculating the price of the goods she was about to offer Birkan.</p><p>Birkan came out the French door and handed her a glass of wine and then set a plate of cheeses on the patio table. He made the requisite small talk. She replied by rote. Idle chatter really wasn&#x2019;t her thing, but Birkan was the kind of man who&#x2019;d dismiss her as a crass American if she got right down to business.</p><p>Finally, he broached the subject himself, swirling his wine before saying, ever so casually, &#x201c;I took a chance inviting you to my home, Ms. Avery. You are a stranger to me and I do not usually invite strangers here. But I made a rare exception, based on your excellent professional reputation.&#x201d;</p><p>That was a lie. According to her sources, he said the same thing to every potential new business associate, to make them feel both honored and obliged to live up to his expectations. And, she presumed, so he could show off his estate&#x2014;a don&#x2019;t-fuck-with-me display of his wealth and power in the supernatural community.</p><p>&#x201c;I will admit,&#x201d; Birkan continued, &#x201c;when you first contacted me, I thought it was a joke. The item you offered&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. well, it is not exactly easy to obtain.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t offer it to you if it was,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;That would be an insult to the quality of your collection.&#x201d;</p><p>He nodded, pleased. &#x201c;Yet you believe you can obtain it? While you have a sterling reputation, I am told it is impossible, even for a master thief.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;True, but I&#x2019;ve come into some information that will make it much easier. And I have a particular thief in mind. One whose reputation surpasses even my own.&#x201d;</p><p>She reached into her briefcase and passed him a file folder. As he read the first page, his brows shot up.</p><p>&#x201c;Karl Marsten? The werewolf?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is that a problem?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;He is notoriously difficult to hire. I have tried myself and have not even been able to arrange a meeting with him.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I can get you one.&#x201d;</p><p>Birkan tapped the folder. &#x201c;So he has not truly retired?&#x201d;</p><p>Avery smiled. &#x201c;Oh, he says he has. But I believe we can persuade him to take one last job.&#x201d;</p><p></p><p></p><p>ONE</p><p>As I edited the piece on chupacabra sightings, I sipped my decaf coffee and ignored the disapproving looks from the sales director. A week ago, she had informed me&#x2014;complete with Web links&#x2014;that even decaf contained caffeine and I was endangering the life of my unborn child. I&#x2019;d pointed out that I&#x2019;d drunk decaf all through my pregnancy with Nita, whereupon she&#x2019;d made some snide comment about my daughter&#x2019;s high activity levels. I ignored that. Nita had a werewolf and a chaos half-demon for parents&#x2014;one couldn&#x2019;t expect her to sit quietly for long.</p><p>I returned my attention to the article, written by an intern who apparently had managed to get through college without learning the difference between &#x201c;there,&#x201d; &#x201c;their,&#x201d; and &#x201c;they&#x2019;re.&#x201d; I had only myself to blame, given that I&#x2019;d hired him. I&#x2019;m now the editor at True News, which would be far more impressive if I hadn&#x2019;t been promoted during a downsizing, when they&#x2019;d decided I could handle the position while still being lead reporter. But it&#x2019;s a miracle we&#x2019;re open at all&#x2014;World Weekly News stopped publishing years ago when the Internet began fulfilling the public&#x2019;s appetite for &#x201c;Proof of Elvis on Mars!&#x201d; stories.</p><p>When my phone rang, I answered with, &#x201c;Hope Adams.&#x201d; My brother, Joel, laughed and said, &#x201c;You guys can&#x2019;t afford call display?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, I can&#x2019;t afford the two seconds it takes to look at it. I&#x2019;m rewriting an intern&#x2019;s piece and lamenting the state of the modern education system. Which makes me feel very old.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maybe so, but I&#x2019;ll join you in that lament. I just hired two MBAs who don&#x2019;t know how to write a proper business letter. Which segues nicely into the reason for my call. Good employees are hard to find, and when you do find one, you do everything in your power to keep him. I need you to talk to your husband.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I thought Karl was working out well.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Better than well. I had three guys working on a security plan for weeks, and they couldn&#x2019;t meet the specs. In two days, Karl had it done. The client was ecstatic.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Okay&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then I put him on this project protecting something called the Anatolian Hoard. It&#x2019;s supposedly cursed, so figured he&#x2019;d get a kick out of it, given what you do for a living.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;So what happened?&#x201d;</p><p>Silence. Then, &#x201c;He didn&#x2019;t tell you? He quit.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I gave him the project yesterday morning. He started work on it. Then, after lunch, he tells me he wanted to go back into sales. I tried to talk him out of it, but you know your husband. I may be his boss, but with Karl that&#x2019;s a technicality. Which is where you come in. Will you talk to him? Please?&#x201d;</p><p>When I married Karl, I knew exactly what he was. Not just a werewolf, but a jewel thief. Hell, I&#x2019;d met him because I&#x2019;d been hired to foil one of his museum heists. So there were no illusions. And the fact that he retired from the life six months ago has nothing to do with me. In fact, if I had my way, he&#x2019;d still be stealing jewels, because that&#x2019;s his life&#x2014;it&#x2019;s how he&#x2019;s lived since his father died when he was fifteen. More important, it&#x2019;s how he works off the nastier instincts that come with being a werewolf. Instead of chasing human prey, he chases the glittering variety, getting his adrenaline rush from that. Nobody understands the importance of that sublimation better than me, as a half-demon who craves the same rush.</p><p>Karl had begun talking about retiring when Nita was born. He&#x2019;d been shot in the head a couple of days before her birth, while I&#x2019;d been taken captive, our unborn daughter held as &#x201c;ransom&#x201d; to get my father&#x2019;s&#x2014;Lucifer&#x2019;s&#x2014;attention. All that had nothing to do with Karl&#x2019;s profession, but it still put things in perspective, and he&#x2019;d wanted to make changes, starting by quitting the life.</p><p>I&#x2019;d convinced him there was no point. He took only a few jobs a year, all out of country, and it would be years before Nita started asking questions. Then we&#x2019;d started working on having another baby, and he&#x2019;d barely broached the subject of quitting again when we had an&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. incident. It was at a Pack Meet. The youngest Pack member, Noah, had asked Karl to show him a few tricks, because he was taking law enforcement in college, so he was curious. Karl obliged. Nita watched. Then we returned home to discover her luggage contained two books, a stuffed animal, and a necklace that she&#x2019;d stolen from the Danvers twins.</p><p>Nita had been very proud of herself, regaling her father with the story as best a three-year-old can tell one. She&#x2019;d gotten a long talk about the notion of private property and a trip back to Stonehaven to return the items with apologies. The twins had been very impressed and made her show them how she&#x2019;d done it&#x2014;getting the books and toy from a high shelf and the jewelry from around Kate&#x2019;s neck. Elena and Jeremy had been amused. Clayton was not. But one person was even more appalled than Clay: Karl. When we got home Sunday night, he&#x2019;d called my brother to see if his long-standing offer of employment still stood.</p><p></p><p></p><p> TWO</p><p>After Joel&#x2019;s call, I packed in my editing early and headed out to find Karl and Nita.</p><p>After Nita was born, we&#x2019;d moved from a condo to a house&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. the sort of home that befits two people with very healthy bank accounts. Not some obscenely tacky modern mansion&#x2014;that isn&#x2019;t Karl&#x2019;s style or mine. It&#x2019;s an early twentieth-century two-story on an acre of land, backing onto a ravine. The money went into the location&#x2014;a neighborhood dating back almost to the time my dad&#x2019;s family landed on the Mayflower. And by &#x201c;dad,&#x201d; I mean Will Adams, the man who raised me, not my biological father. Dad&#x2019;s family may be old, but compared with Lucifer&#x2019;s, they&#x2019;re strictly new blood.</p><p>Given the time, Karl and Nita would be at the park. Karl worked only part-time for Joel, doing as much as possible from home, because he was the primary caregiver for our daughter. As he says, there&#x2019;s only a brief window before kids go off to school, and it&#x2019;s an experience he&#x2019;s never going to get again.</p><p>Even from the parking lot, I could see my husband. In a sea of au pairs, nannies, and mothers, the only man stuck out. Not that Karl wouldn&#x2019;t stick out anyway. He&#x2019;s fifty-six, but werewolves age slowly, so he looks more like a forty-year-old guy in prime condition: six feet tall, well built, wavy black hair barely touched with silver, and a face that belongs on the silver screen. Of course, being married to him, I could be biased, but the looks he got from the other caregivers said I was not.</p><p>As Karl watched Nita on the climbers, a couple of the twenty-something nannies stood nearby, trying to catch his attention and failing miserably. When Karl switches on the charm, he&#x2019;s undeniable, which is why he&#x2019;d made a good salesman. Yet it really is a switch, and when it&#x2019;s off, that&#x2019;s a hint: leave him alone or you&#x2019;ll wish you had.</p><p>When he saw me, that somber expression broke into a smile and he turned&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. just as Nita attempted to leap across three bars. I yelped a warning, but Karl was already in flight, catching her as deftly as if he&#x2019;d never taken his eyes off her, which he hadn&#x2019;t, not completely.</p><p>&#x201c;Oh, your nanny&#x2019;s here,&#x201d; one of the women said, adding, &#x201c;Finally,&#x201d; with a look that told me I really shouldn&#x2019;t force my poor boss to&#x2014;God forbid&#x2014;take care of his own child.</p><p>As for why she presumed I was the nanny, let&#x2019;s just say that every other woman of color in that playground was caring for someone else&#x2019;s kids. My mother is Indo-American, and being half-demon means I get my looks from her. That&#x2019;s when Nita spotted me and let out a whoop of &#x201c;Mommy!&#x201d; diving from Karl&#x2019;s arms. I scooped her up as Karl came over and kissed me, and the nannies decided they really ought to get back to, you know, actually watching the kids they were being paid to watch.</p><p>&#x201c;Mommy, Mommy, Mommy,&#x201d; Nita sang as she hugged me tight enough to inhibit breathing. &#x201c;Did you see me jump?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I saw you nearly fall.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Daddy caught me.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Daddy won&#x2019;t always be there to catch you,&#x201d; I said, ignoring the look on Karl&#x2019;s face that said he damned well would be. &#x201c;You need to be more careful. Or you&#x2019;ll take a tumble and&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Break my arm,&#x201d; she said, giggling. &#x201c;Kate broke her arm. I want to break mine.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No, you do not.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I never broke a bone. I want to.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;To see what it&#x2019;s like? I&#x2019;ll tell you. It hurts.&#x201d;</p><p>She shrugged, as if this was inconsequential compared with the thrill of a new experience, and I cursed Lucifer for that. When Nita was born, my demon father said she would inherit some of my chaos hunger, making it more manageable for me. Which it is, but it&#x2019;s left my daughter with a thirst for adventure that keeps us very, very busy. This is as bad as it will get, though, and if pressed I&#x2019;ll admit that&#x2019;s not such a horrible thing, and it&#x2019;s not entirely the fault of my genes. If I were too worried, I certainly wouldn&#x2019;t be having a second child.</p><p>&#x201c;Park done, Daddy.&#x201d; Nita twisted in my arms and launched herself back at her father. &#x201c;Ice cream time.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I believe ice cream is on Tuesdays,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Today is Thursday.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Mommy&#x2019;s having a baby. She needs ice cream. My book says so. Milk and cheese and ice cream for&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Her face screwed up.</p><p>&#x201c;Calcium,&#x201d; I said.</p><p>&#x201c;Calcium!&#x201d; she said, screeching the word like she&#x2019;d found a new toy. &#x201c;Calcium, calcium, calcium. Mommy needs calcium. Mommy needs ice cream.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re right,&#x201d; Karl said. &#x201c;So we&#x2019;ll buy Mommy some. You and I will sit and watch&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;No! Daddy watch. Mommy and Nita eat. Need calcium, calcium, calcium!&#x201d; She wriggled down, saying, &#x201c;Slide!&#x201d; and then took off for one last ride, running and singing at the top of her lungs.</p><p>&#x201c;She&#x2019;s such a deeply unhappy child,&#x201d; Karl said. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know where we went wrong.&#x201d;</p><p>I laughed. Nita does have a temper&#x2014;no idea where that came from&#x2014;but the best word to describe our daughter is <i>exuberant</i>. I watched her run off, black curls streaming behind her. If the nannies were surprised she was my daughter, they needed glasses. Her big blue eyes are Karl&#x2019;s, but otherwise she has my hair, my features, and skin only a shade lighter. Also, sadly, she has inherited her mother&#x2019;s size, meaning we&#x2019;ve just barely gotten out of the infants&#x2019; section.</p><p>Karl took my hand, entwining it in his as we walked. When we first started dating&#x2014;after two years of being friends&#x2014;he&#x2019;d have no more held my hand in public than he&#x2019;d have worn brown shoes with black trousers. I won&#x2019;t say marriage and kids have mellowed him, but they&#x2019;ve calmed something in his core. It is the realization of a goal he never allowed himself to even acknowledge. He had a stable life now&#x2014;with territory and family&#x2014;and public displays of affection declared that this was his choice and he was happy with it.</p><p>His hand tightened around mine. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d ask if you got done early, but I know that never happens.

He held some local political offices, in addition to a seat in the Kentucky House of Representatives. Caudill's 1963 book, <i> Night Comes to the Cumberlands: A Biography of a Depressed Area</i> was and is a very influential work on Eastern Kentucky, affecting local and national government through individuals ranging from President Kennedy to Kentucky governors and Appalachian writers such as Denise Giardina.

The challenge it poses&#x2014;how to live in our present moment alongside deep pasts and futures&#x2014;brings into sharp focus the importance of grasping the nature of our intimate relationship with geological time. In <i>Anthropocene Poetics</i>, David Farrier shows how contemporary poetry by Elizabeth Bishop, Seamus Heaney, Evelyn Reilly, and Christian B�k, among others, provides us with frameworks for thinking about this uncanny sense of time.</p><p>Looking at a diverse array of lyric and avant-garde poetry from three interrelated perspectives&#x2014;the Anthropocene and the &#x201c;material turn&#x201d; in environmental philosophy; the Plantationocene and the role of global capitalism in environmental crisis; and the emergence of multispecies ethics and extinction studies&#x2014;Farrier rethinks the environmental humanities from a literary critical perspective. <i>Anthropocene Poetics</i> puts a concern with deep time at the center, defining a new poetics for thinking through humanity&#x2019;s role as geological agents, the devastation caused by resource extraction, and the looming extinction crisis.&nbsp;</p></p><p><p>David Farrier is senior lecturer in modern and contemporary literature at the University of Edinburgh. He is author of <i>Unsettled Narratives: The Pacific Writings of Stevenson, Ellis, Melville, and London</i> and <i>Postcolonial Asylum: Seeking Sanctuary before the Law</i>.</p>"The Anthropocene spells trouble: not only with respect to the global environmental changes, largely for the worse, to which it refers; but also in terms of the troublesome nature of the word itself. David Farrier&#x2019;s brilliant elucidation of a multi-faceted &#x2018;Anthropocene poetics&#x2019; delves into these troubles with great philosophical, scientific, social-ecological and aesthetic discernment. Whilst acknowledging the limited efficacy of poetry in response to the immense challenges of our perilous times, his carefully contextualized close readings of exemplary texts do indeed demonstrate how literature, and other art forms, can &#x2018;help to frame the ground on which we stand as we consider which way to turn.&#x2019; This is, moreover, not only a work about poetry: it is also an exquisitely poetic work of scholarship."&#x2014;Catherine Rigby, Bath Spa University, author of <i>Dancing with Disaster</i><br><br> "In <i>Anthropocene Poetics</i>, David Farrier ventures into a poetics of the Anthropocene and calls for the need to create &#x2018;an Anthropocenic literary imagination.&#x2019; Exploring the Anthropocene conundrums and dysphorias with avant-garde and lyric poetry, <i>Anthropocene Poetics</i> will certainly change the way we perceive deep time as well as our understanding of the poem. Imagine a creative becoming enfolded by the new poetics of deep and thick time!"&#x2014;Serpil Oppermann, Cappadocia University<br><br> "The Anthropocene needs poetry. With its vorticular temporalities, swift shifts in scale, enmeshment of the human and the nonhuman, and constant challenges to the adequacy of language, this age of ecological crisis may never be better understood by any other technology&#x2014;even as the Anthropocene changes what we understand a poem to do. David Farrier&#x2019;s brilliant new book is a rapturous meditation on ecocriticism, time, the limits of human comprehension, and the power of the humanities in a turbulent era."&#x2014;Jeffrey Jerome Cohen, author of <i>Stone: An Ecology of the Inhuman</i></p><h2>The Diva Spices It Up (A Domestic Diva Mystery)</h2><p><b>She's a young Martha Stewart...in Old Town Virginia! <br>New York Times bestselling author Krista Davis delights with the 13th in her enormously popular and completely charming Domestic Diva Mystery series.

But Leontyne had big dreams&#x2014;and plenty to be thankful for&#x2014;as she surrounded herself with church hymns and hallelujahs, soaked up opera arias on the radio, and watched the great Marian Anderson grace the stage.&nbsp; <br> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <br>While racism made it unlikely that a poor black girl from the South would pursue an opera career, Leontyne&#x2019;s wondrous voice and unconquerable spirit prevailed.

Raul lives in New York with his wife.Gr 2&#x2013;5&#x2014; Weatherford continues to showcase groundbreaking African Americans often overlooked by history books and popular culture. World-famous opera singer Leontyne Price gets her due in this luscious picture book biography. Price's talent and perseverance enabled her to follow in the footsteps of singer Marian Anderson and become a celebrated soprano whose wondrous voice rang through the Metropolitan Opera House in her iconic Aida role and on Broadway as a lead in Porgy and Bess. A true marriage of lyrical text and majestic illustrations, the book shines a much-needed spotlight on an important cultural figure. Col�n's earthy hues establish the tone of Price's early years, set against the backdrop of her humble Mississippi upbringing and a childhood surrounded by supportive parents and gospel music. The watercolor and pencil drawings seem to vibrate off the page, especially in the form of rainbow-colored musical notes that often envelop the work's subject. An author's note includes more information on other singers for whom Price paved the way. While the exact audience for this book is hard to place, the emphasis on the performer's predecessors ("The song of her soul soared on the breath of her ancestors.") and mentions of segregation will tie this title into units on African American history and female pioneers.

For more than a decade, Martha Stewart and the editors of Martha Stewart Weddings have guided brides down the aisle, onto the dance floor, and over the threshold with thousands of ideas for making their wedding day unforgettable. In this breathtakingly beautiful volume, brides-to-be -- or anyone participating in planning this joyous event -- will find ideas and inspiration for every element of a wedding, including decoration, flowers, cakes, food, favors, and photography.<br><br>The very best ideas from Martha Stewart Weddings have been organized here in four sections--For the Ceremony, For the Reception, Forever, and For Reference. For the Ceremony is filled with bridal bouquets, boutonnieres, and bridesmaids flowers. There are decorating ideas for every kind of ceremony imaginable -- a classic clapboard church, a grassy meadow, or the family living room. For the Reception features exquisite lighting ideas, a selection of drinks and hors d'oeuvres, charming favors for guests, and, of course, cakes. There are more than 30 cakes to inspire you, and there is one to suit every style, taste, and budget. Novice bakers can learn how to make a basic wedding cake in Wedding Cake 101. Forever includes albums, guest books, and keepsakes.

The book is designed to provide inspiration for the big day, whether it is for the ceremony or the reception. Wedding apparel isn't covered, but all of the other significant parts of the wedding are: ceremony and reception decorating, bouquets and boutonnieres, wedding cakes, favors, guest books, music--even storage and display of photographs and other memorabilia after the wedding. <p> Stewart encourages readers to use the book's ideas as inspiration for wedding elements unique to the bride and groom, and to avoid simply incorporating the book's ideas into their wedding day. She emphasizes that a wedding should reflect the couple's personality and wishes, as well as any customs they choose to follow. There are few rules of etiquette � la Emily Post. Instead, the book provides historical explanations of common wedding traditions, then gives examples of variations on that tradition that couples have decided to use in their weddings. Stylishly arranged color photographs of the bouquets, wedding cakes, reception decorations, table settings, party favors, and more bring the ideas to life; instructions for reproducing them are often provided.</p><p> Many of Martha's suggestions are doable even on a budget because they stick to simple, classic design. The reference section at the end of the book includes ceremony and reception planning and seating tips; music suggestions; recipes for cakes, drinks, and hors d'oeuvres; and sources for wedding supplies. <i>The Best of Martha Stewart Living: Weddings</i> should prove a rich source of inspiration for couples looking to add stylish and meaningful touches to their wedding day. <i>--Kris Law</i></p><b>Martha Stewart Living </b>was first published in 1990.

President Thomas Jefferson keenly understood that the course of the nation's destiny lay westward and that a national "Voyage of Discovery" must be mounted to determine the nature and accessibility of the frontier. He commissioned his young secretary, Meriwether Lewis, to lead an intelligence-gathering expedition from the Missouri River to the northern Pacific coast and back. From 1804 to 1806, Lewis, accompanied by co-captain William Clark, the Shoshone guide Sacajawea, and thirty-two men, made the first trek across the Louisiana Purchase, mapping the rivers as he went, tracing the principal waterways to the sea, and establishing the American claim to the territories of Idaho, Washington, and Oregon. Together the captains kept a journal, a richly detailed record of the flora and fauna they sighted, the Indian tribes they encountered, and the awe-inspiring landscape they traversed, from their base camp near present-day St. Louis to the mouth of the Columbia River. In keeping this record they made an incomparable contribution to the literature of exploration and the writing of natural history.</p><p>Frank Bergon is a novelist and professor at Vassar College</p><h2>Little Jordan Ray&#39;s Muddy Spud</h2><p>Crafting a story rooted in his admiration of Lewis Carroll, L.

Distilled poppies reduce melancholy. A Turkish drink called coffee increases alertness. Tobacco cures cancer. Such beliefs circulated in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, an era when the term "drug" encompassed everything from herbs and spices&#x2014;like nutmeg, cinnamon, and chamomile&#x2014;to such deadly poisons as lead, mercury, and arsenic. In <i>The Age of Intoxication</i>, Benjamin Breen offers a window into a time when drugs were not yet separated into categories&#x2014;illicit and licit, recreational and medicinal, modern and traditional&#x2014;and there was no barrier between the drug dealer and the pharmacist.</p><p>Focusing on the Portuguese colonies in Brazil and Angola and on the imperial capital of Lisbon, Breen examines the process by which novel drugs were located, commodified, and consumed. He then turns his attention to the British Empire, arguing that it owed much of its success in this period to its usurpation of the Portuguese drug networks. From the sickly sweet tobacco that helped finance the Atlantic slave trade to the cannabis that an East Indies merchant sold to the natural philosopher Robert Hooke in one of the earliest European coffeehouses, Breen shows how drugs have been entangled with science and empire from the very beginning.</p><p>Featuring numerous illuminating anecdotes and a cast of characters that includes merchants, slaves, shamans, prophets, inquisitors, and alchemists, <i>The Age of Intoxication</i> rethinks a history of drugs and the early drug trade that has too often been framed as opposites&#x2014;between medicinal and recreational, legal and illegal, good and evil. Breen argues that, in order to guide drug policy toward a fairer and more informed course, we first need to understand who and what set the global drug trade in motion.</p></p><p>Benjamin Breen teaches history at University of California, Santa Cruz.<p>Introduction<br>At the Statue of Adamastor</p><p></p><blockquote>O reckless people . . . you have breached what is forbidden!<br>&#x2014;Adamastor to Vasco da Gama, <i>Os Lus�adas</i>, 1572</blockquote><p></p><p>In a city known for its spectacular vistas, one place in Lisbon stands out: a small patch of grass and stone called the Miradouro do Adamastor. It is sleepy during the day, frequented mostly by tourists and the occasional stray cat eager to take in its panoramic views. But as the sun sets over the Tejo River, revelers from the city's nightlife districts crowd the south end of this tiny plaza. Dealers in MDMA, hashish, and cocaine begin to ply their wares. By nightfall on a typical Friday, the Miradouro do Adamastor has become one of the busiest drug markets in Portugal.</p><p>The north end of the plaza is very different. This side is dominated by an elegant building that happens to house Lisbon's Museum of Pharmacy. One spring evening several years ago, I watched an intoxicated man climb on top of the stone statue that stands at the center of the plaza, his back to the museum. "Lisbon doesn't care about me!" he shouted in Angolan-accented Portuguese. The people behind the statue pretended not to notice. With time, however, the tall iron fence that divides the museum from the plaza began to seem to me like a statement in its own right. The fence proclaims the museum's symbolic and physical distance from the drug dealers and drug users beyond: the scientific realm of the medical, standing apart from the messy world of intoxication.</p><p>And as for the statue at the center of it all? The sculpted figure, rising out of rough-hewn rock, is an imperial Portuguese imagining of an African demigod. In <i>The Lusiads</i>, the sixteenth-century poetic epic of the Portuguese Empire, Adamastor is the name given to a giant who battles the navigator Vasco da Gama. As da Gama and his men round Africa's Cape of Good Hope, a "deformed and enormous" figure rises in the night air "like a second Colossus of Rhodes, most strange to see . . . its hair curly and filled with earth . . . its mouth black." Adamastor, the "Spirit of the Cape," tries and fails to repel the Portuguese from reaching the "strong and potent drugs" of the Indies. Today, Lisbon's Adamastor stands frozen in an expression of futile rage, staring out to sea. A tiny figure of Vasco da Gama perches on the edge of his beard. </p><p>It would be hard to find a better starting point for the stories told in this book. The African god and his Portuguese enemy, united in their silent contemplation of a gateway to the Atlantic Ocean. The drug sellers below, often recent immigrants from Brazil, Angola, or Mozambique, whose personal journeys map onto the older pathways of Portugal's vanished empire. And, looming behind them, the silent wall dividing the street drugs of the miradouro from the medical drugs of the museum.</p><p><i>The Age of Intoxication</i> argues against this division. It is a window into a time when there was no barrier between the museum and the marketplace&#x2014;or between the drug dealer and the pharmacist. Here the reader will encounter merchants, slaves, shamans, prophets, <i>feiticeiros</i>, inquisitors, witches, alchemists, and natural philosophers. I don't claim that these figures all saw themselves as participating in the same profession, trade, or worldview. On the contrary, the global drug trade emerged out of conflict and difference. It was, and is, rooted in a spectrum of beliefs that are difficult to draw together. A random selection of opinions held by individuals in this book would include the following: Eating the powdered flesh of an Egyptian mummy may cure the plague. Distilled poppies reduce melancholy. A Turkish drink called coffee increases alertness. The arterial blood of a murderer is the best thing for an epileptic, especially when collected and drunk immediately after the murderer's public beheading. Tobacco cures cancer. Possessing an enemy's toenail clippings may allow you to kill them.</p><p>The global drug trade was an emergent property, born of a ferment of different beliefs, practices, and conflicts, following a course that was neither planned nor expected. But I believe that it is important to try to see the drug trade as a unified whole. In the early modern era (the period spanning roughly 1500 to 1800 CE) the drug trade became truly global in scope&#x2014;and the world changed in ways both familiar and forgotten. This book's title, <i>The Age of Intoxication</i>, is a deliberate provocation in this regard. It has fallen out of fashion for historians to refer to an "Age of Reason" in the late seventeenth and eighteenth centuries, but the term continues to resonate in the popular imagination. I argue that the globalization of drugs during the same period was an event with impacts on global health, material culture, and intellectual life that were arguably even more transformative than the unevenly distributed intellectual currents of the Enlightenment. Rather than limiting this book to the study of <i>only</i> medicinal drugs or <i>only</i> recreational ones, I have thus chosen to study psychoactive and medicinal drugs in tandem so as to better capture the full scope of their impacts.</p><p>The substances we will learn about fall into different categories today. There are pharmaceuticals like quinine, so-called "traditional remedies" like St.-John's-wort or rhinoceros horn, New Age and homeopathic cures, food-like drugs or drug-like foods such as sugar, and illegal narcotics like heroin. In chronicling how these substances circulated during the first era of globalization, it became clear that the permanence of such divisions&#x2014;between illicit and licit, recreational and medicinal, modern and traditional&#x2014;is illusory. These boundaries were radically different in the past, and they are shifting beneath our feet today. In order for people of the present day to guide drug policy toward a fairer and more informed course, we first need to understand who and what set it on its present trajectory.</p><p>The chapters that follow trace the drug trade's emergence on a world stage, the main points of contact and conflict that key early modern drugs initiated, and the accompanying backlashes. For instance, the Atlantic slave trade was not just a trade in human beings but also a commerce in psychoactive drugs. The Scientific Revolution, likewise, was partially inspired by questions about how novel "Indies" drugs acted on mind and body, and what latent "virtues" they concealed. The shape taken by globalization was forever altered by this early modern era of drugs. In understanding the age before the pharmacy museum and the recreational drug market became separated by physical and ideological walls, we will learn more about how the modern world itself came into being&#x2014;and about the age of intoxication that we still live in.</p><p>Why Does Drug History Matter?</p><p>The range of substances that early modern Europeans classified as "drugs" was truly vast. The term encompassed everything from herbs and spices (like nutmeg, cinnamon, and chamomile) to deadly poisons (like lead, mercury, and arsenic). Some early modern drugs, such as oil of roses or lavender, appealed to the senses. Others revolted against them, like the 1609 recipe that called for the sick to consume "the corpse of an unblemished twenty-four-year-old red-haired man . . . torn into strips and sprinkled with powdered myrrh and aloe." An early modern apothecary&#x2014;a vendor and preparer of drugs&#x2014;might sell Egyptian mummies, Neolithic artifacts, narwhal tusks, bird beaks, powdered pearls, and drinkable gold. Drugs could dispel or enact curses, increase sexual desire or banish it, ease the pains of childbirth or induce abortion, kill in agony or dissipate all sensation in an opiated haze. Amid this enormous diversity, however, there were also common traits. The unifying definition of the substances called "drugs" in this book is that they are <i>things consumed to alter the mind or body</i>. I sometimes use terms like "psychoactive" or "intoxicating" to refer to these effects, but it is important to remember that contemporary medical definitions of psychoactivity and the more capacious one that I use here are not identical.</p><p>It is also worth noting that most of the drugs surveyed in these pages were not effective by modern medical standards. A few, like opium or cinchona bark, are botanical precursors of contemporary pharmaceuticals. In some cases, studying premodern or non-Western drugs has led to significant breakthroughs, like the Nobel Prize-winning antimalarial drug artemisinin (i.e., <i>q&#x12b;ngh&#x101;os�</i>,&#x9752;&#x84bf;&#x7d20;), brought to market on the basis of a traditional Chinese remedy, or ibogaine, a compound found in the root of the African <i>Tabernanthe iboga</i> tree,which has shown potential for treating addiction. Nevertheless, most drugs studied in this book likely have no empirical therapeutic value. So, leaving aside our natural curiosity about the weird, wizardly contents of apothecary jars or the remarkable lives of drug merchants, cultivators, and consumers, why do their histories matter?</p><p>Because this book is about the early modern era, I don't enter here into debates about the deep human past. However, I do proceed from a broad perspective: I believe that it is impossible to understand human history without accounting for the centrality of drug taking as a fundamental human impulse. The desire to alter mental and physical states by ingesting natural products appears to number among the defining traits of our species. It is a behavior that arguably deserves a position alongside the more celebrated human expressive modes, like dance, music, or language. And if the intentional alteration of conscious or physical states is a fundamental element in human behavior, then so, too, is the desire to find meaning in these states. Humans are the only animal that <i>prepares</i>, <i>trades</i>, and <i>explains</i> drugs. Drugs play a significant role in human societal differentiation, cultural and material exchange, and, in some cases, conflict.</p><p>Today, nonmedical drug use is often given the label "recreational," but this is a deeply inadequate phrase. The desire to escape the mind's confines is an ancient and profound one. Sometimes the impulse can be destructive; other times, it offers an outlet for dispelling fear or frustration, making sense of hardship or gaining knowledge. In either account, the impulse runs deep. Some archaeologists have theorized that the introduction of alcohol can be identified in the archaeological record of Bronze Age Europe, when new ceramic forms appear to have been linked to the emergence of rituals of intoxication. For the most part, however, the early chapters of drug history stretch so far back into the human past that they remain unwritten and, perhaps, unwriteable. Indeed, humanity's ancient alliances with caffeine and alcohol have become so deeply embedded in many societies around the world that we rarely reflect on the fact that these everyday substances even <i>are</i> drugs. They are part of the fabric of our world&#x2014;and our shared histories, from Peru to Africa to China.</p><p>Almost as ancient as the evidence for alcohol and caffeine use are the archaeological records of the use of drugs sometimes known as <i>entheogens,</i> a word deriving from the Greek <i>&#x1f14;&#x3bd;&#x3b8;&#x3b5;&#x3bf;&#x3c2;</i> (<i>�ntheos</i>), meaning "god within" or "inspired by a god." In Mesoamerica, archaeological records documenting entheogens like peyote (<i>Lophophora williamsii</i>) stretches back at least as far as the Olmec era, circa 1200&#x2012;400 BCE. We should be wary of drawing a clear line between the use of these drugs in spiritual, recreational, or medical settings. They often serve all three simultaneously. An emerging scientific consensus points to the utility of drugs like mescaline and psilocybin as treatments for disorders such as alcoholism, PTSD (post-traumatic stress disorder), and severe depression. They have been lauded as tools for obtaining "self-knowledge and psychological insight." But as we'll see, substances like peyote and psilocybin have also been attacked as dangerous intoxicants. Today, the United States, both remain classified as Schedule 1 drugs. In the end, I suspect it is impossible to draw a clear line between recreational and therapeutic use of a drug. But this has not stopped modern societies from attempting to do just that.</p><p>The chapters that follow document how the early modern drug trade emerged, grew, and split into <i>licit</i> (medicinal, scientific, legal) and <i>illicit</i> (recreational, irrational, illegal) branches. This book will also explore how drugs have served as a kind of advance guard for both the allure and the dangers of global trade, and as a catalyst for slave traders, scientists, and agents of empire. Newly globalized psychoactive substances from the tropical and subtropical regions, which Europeans called "the Indies," prompted new racialized and religious fears of foreign drugs, as well as new scientific questions and methods.</p><p>Today, legacies of the early modern globalization of drugs shape our world in ways both seen and unseen. In the Philippines, an estimated 7,000 people were executed by police and vigilantes because of supposed links to drug dealing in late 2016 and early 2017 alone. Roughly half of the inmates in U.S. federal prisons as of 2015 were serving time for so-called drug offenses. Meanwhile, the trade in <i>legal</i> drugs has emerged as one of the planet's largest and most powerful industries. One in six Americans is thought to regularly consume psychiatric drugs. In 2015, an estimated 38 percent of American adults were prescribed opioids. And substances like tobacco, coffee, and alcoholic spirits (which all fell under the early modern definition of drugs) account for a truly massive portion of global advertising budgets and consumer spending.</p><p>By reframing certain drugs as foreign invaders or markers of societal decline rather than acknowledging drug taking's ancient role in nearly all human societies, modern states have committed unspeakable crimes. The assumptions underlying drug criminalization include concerns about bodily and mental purity and the trope of intoxication as an enemy of civilization. This book shows how these associations arose out of early modern conceptions of racial difference, fears of non-Christian spirituality, and the commercial imperatives of merchants, slavers, and medical professionals. Drugs became illegal not because of the arbitrary decisions of government leaders in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries but because of deep-seated epistemological, commercial, and social structures that emerged during an earlier age of globalization on the plantation, on the slave ship, and on the surgeon's table.</p><p>Defining Drugs, and How to Study Them</p><p>In modern English, French, Spanish, and Portuguese, drug/<i>drogue</i>/<i>droga</i> has a well-known double meaning. It can signify either "a natural or synthetic substance used in the prevention or treatment of disease" or "a substance with intoxicating, stimulant, or narcotic effects used for cultural, recreational or other non-medical purposes." But the genealogy of the word is more tangled than this distinction might imply. It first entered English and several other European languages in the fourteenth century (seemingly from a Middle Dutch word...</p></p><h2>Arts of the Possible: Essays and Conversations</h2><p><p><strong>"Adrienne Rich's new prose collection could have been titled <em>The Essential Rich</em>."&#x2015;<em>Women's Review of Books</em></strong></p> These essays trace a distinguished writer's engagement with her time, her arguments with herself and others. "I am a poet who knows the social power of poetry, a United States citizen who knows herself irrevocably tangled in her society's hopes, arrogance, and despair," Adrienne Rich writes. The essays in <em>Arts of the Possible</em> search for possibilities beyond a compromised, degraded system, seeking to imagine something else. They call on the fluidity of the imagination, from poetic vision to social justice, from the badlands of political demoralization to an art that might wound, that may open scars when engaged in its work, but will finally suture and not tear apart. This volume collects Rich's essays from the last decade of the twentieth century, including four earlier essays, as well as several conversations that go further than the usual interview. Also included is her essay explaining her reasons for declining the National Medal for the Arts. "The work is inspired and inspiring."&#x2015;Alicia Ostriker "[S]o clear and clean and thorough. I learn from her again and again."&#x2015;Grace Paley</p><p>Widely read, widely anthologized, widely interviewed, and widely taught, Adrienne Rich (1929&#x2013;2012) was for decades among the most influential writers of the feminist movement and one of the best-known American public intellectuals. She wrote two dozen volumes of poetry and more than a half-dozen of prose. Her constellation of honors includes two National Book Awards, a MacArthur Foundation &#x201c;genius&#x201d; grant, and a Medal for Distinguished Contribution to American Letters by the National Book Foundation. Ms. Rich&#x2019;s volumes of poetry include The Dream of a Common Language, A Wild Patience Has Taken Me This Far, An Atlas of the Difficult World, The School Among the Ruins, and Telephone Ringing in the Labyrinth. Her prose includes the essay collections On Lies, Secrets, and Silence; Blood, Bread, and Poetry; an influential essay, &#x201c;Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence,&#x201d; and the nonfiction book Of Woman Born, which examines the institution of motherhood as a socio-historic construct. In 2010, she was honored with The Griffin Trust for Excellence in Poetry's Lifetime Recognition Award.Rich's engaging new collection of essays reaffirms what Norton editors declared some 25 years ago: the "private poet" has gone public, "without sacrificing the complexity of subjective experience or the intensity of personal emotion." This certainly holds true for Rich the essayist as well, for she has firmly established herself as a major American poet and intellectual most concerned with the intersection of the public and private, the social and personal. The overarching goal of her intellectual project is to discover what's imaginatively possible in a cultural system debased by economic, social and political injustice, which, she suggests, are perhaps inherent in capitalism. While her powerful and frequently anthologized essay on "compulsory heterosexuality" is not included, the equally famous and influential "`When We Dead Awaken': Writing as Re-Vision" leads off the collection. This 1971 feminist tract brilliantly strategizes how women can re-examine literature and culture in order to resist patriarchal hegemony and give voice to their own experience. Other notable entries include "Blood, Bread, and Poetry: The Location of the Poet," which posits that "political struggle and spiritual continuity are meshed"; the title essay, a consideration of, among other issues, identity politics; and the spirited 1997 essay-letter that explains why she declined the National Medal for the Arts. As Rich herself acknowledges in the foreword, a few of the essays "may seem to belong to a bygone era." They provide, however, a prism through which to view Rich's thinking over the years, and they neatly demonstrate the transformations in her views over time. While the essays, "notes" and "conversations" may be read individually, what's perhaps most fascinating and rewarding about this collection is charting Rich's intellectual journey itself. <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Project UFO (Choose Your Own Adventure #27)</h2><p><b>Project UFO</b> by R.

In comparison to the South, the far West, and New England, its history has been sadly neglected. To spark more attention to their region, midwestern historians will need to explain the Midwest&#x2019;s crucial roles in the development of the entire country: it helped spark the American Revolution and stabilized the young American republic by strengthening its economy and endowing it with an agricultural heartland; it played a critical role in the Union victory in the Civil War; it extended the republican institutions created by the American founders, and then its settler populism made those institutions more democratic; it weakened and decentered the cultural dominance of the urban East; and its bustling land markets deepened Americans&#x2019; embrace of capitalist institutions and attitudes.</p> <p><br> In addition to outlining the centrality of the Midwest to crucial moments in American history, Jon K. Lauck resurrects the long-forgotten stories of the institutions founded by an earlier generation of midwestern historians, from state historical societies to the Mississippi Valley Historical Association. Their strong commitment to local and regional communities rooted their work in place and gave it an audience outside the academy. He also explores the works of these scholars, showing that they researched a broad range of themes and topics, often pioneering fields that remain vital today.</p> <p><i><br> The Lost Region</i> demonstrates the importance of the Midwest, the depth of historical work once written about the region, the continuing insights that can be gleaned from this body of knowledge, and the lessons that can be learned from some of its prominent historians, all with the intent of once again finding the forgotten center of the nation and developing a robust historiography of the Midwest.</p> <br></p><p><p>Attorney, historian, and senior advisor and counsel to South Dakota Senator John Thune, <b>Jon K. Lauck</b> is the author of three previous books on midwestern political and economic history and the coauthor and coeditor of a collection of essays on South Dakota&#x2019;s political culture. His prize-winning articles and reviews have been published widely. Lauck lives in Sioux Falls, South Dakota, with his wife Amy and three children, Brendtly, Abigail, and Henry.</p>&#x201c;<i>The Lost Region</i> should be a significant contribution to midwestern history. As far as I know, no one has pulled together such a substantial reflection on the past and potential future of the field.&#x201d;&#x2014;Pamela Riney-Kehrberg, Iowa State University<br><br><br>&#x201c;Jon Lauck has written the definitive manifesto for a new midwestern historiography. Deeply researched, elegantly written, passionate yet sensible in its themes, it is a stunning book. One hopes that it will stun the coasties, for example, who believe that the fly-over states, many of them beginning with the letter I, have no serious history. Lauck shows that an America without the Midwest would have been&nbsp;less fair, less strong, less prosperous, and above all less democratic. Lauck is the new Frederick Jackson Turner, reminding us that the Midwest is the master spring of American history&#x2014;without which, not.&#x201d;&#x2014;Deirdre McCloskey, Distinguished Professor of History, University of Illinois at Chicago, and author, <i>The Bourgeois Virtues</i><br><br>&#x201c;Jon Lauck justifiably laments the neglect of the Midwest by both the contemporary media and, more surprisingly, by historians, but this book is a robust and persuasive response rather than a complaint. The Midwest is vital to any explanation of the United States, and at one time midwesterners&#x2014;particularly his Prairie Historians&#x2014;explained the region to itself and praised its importance to the rest of the country. He is right. Historians need to refill the space they once occupied.&#x201d;&#x2014;Richard White, Stanford University<br></p><h2>Thai Die: A Needlecraft Mystery</h2><p>Back from a trip to Thailand, Doris Valentine is eager to show Betsy, owner of the Crewel World needlework shop, her souvenirs.

This new campaign by the Christian west against the forces of eastern Islam would culminate in the 1148 siege of Damascus, then the capital city of an Islamic state that had been friendly towards the crusaders. Despite the earlier successes for the crusaders at Antioch and Jerusalem, and the weak fortifications around Damascus, the siege proved a dismal and embarrassing failure for the western armies. The siege was abandoned soon after it had started and the crusaders retreated. This defeat shocked the Christian world and dealt a severe blow to the confidence of the crusading armies, while bolstering the morale of their enemies. </p><p>Utilizing numerous illustrations and full-color artwork, medieval warfare expert David Nicolle analyzes the often-debated battles around Damascus, explaining how the domination of the surrounding countryside by the Islamic forces became the decisive factor, and how the besieging crusading forces found themselves under siege. He also looks at the crusade in the larger context of the battle between East and West and explains how the Second Crusade proved a turning point in this ongoing struggle.</p></p><p>Born in 1944, David Nicolle worked in the BBC&#39;s Arabic service for a number of years before gaining an MA from the School of Oriental and African Studies, London, and a doctorate from Edinburgh University. He has written numerous books and articles on medieval and Islamic warfare, and has been a prolific author of Osprey titles for many years. The author lives in Leicestershire, UK.<p>&#x201c;Nicolle, a scholar in medieval and Islamic warfare, has brought his extensive knowledge to his latest book.&nbsp; The book is divided into several headings: Opposing Commanders, Opposing Forces, Opposing Plans, The Campaign, and Aftermath.&nbsp; He provides a balanced narrative of what went right and wrong for the opposing forces. Interspersed throughout the book are a number of photographs and color illustrations.&nbsp; The illustrations are by Christa Hook.&nbsp; Three of the illustrations are two-page ones that portray key events that occurred during the campaign.&nbsp; In addition, there are several maps included that show the land route that the Crusaders took on their way to the Holy Land and the battle.&nbsp; The battle maps help you understand how the different skirmishes related to the siege of Damascus. This book is a fine companion to the other two volumes published by Osprey that highlight the First and Third Crusades.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Jeff Grim, www.collectedmiscellany.com</i></p><p>&#x201c;David Nicholle has been the author of a number of books from this time period and is highly qualified to tell the story of this campaign, pulling the reader into the prose. Like other books in the Campaign series, there is a look at the opposing commanders and their troops. The plans of both sides are also scrutinized as well as a look at how the battles unfolded. This is followed by a section on how this affected future events and a look at the battlefields today. The superb illustrations and maps of Christa Hook further enhance the story along with photos of the various sites as they are today, period illustrations and artifacts. The 3-D maps in particular help give a sense of the flow of the various battles. It is a great book, especially for the student of the period and show that overconfidence is as much an enemy as are spears and arrows.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Scott Van Aken, modelingmadness.com (March 2009)</i></p></p><h2>Bad Guys of the Book of Mormon</h2><p>The Book of Mormon is full of heroes Nephi, Alma the Younger, Abinadi, Captain Moroni and we read about their lives, looking for lessons that will help us be more like them.

Thomas Chippering, a 6'6" professor of linguistics, is a man torn between two obsessions: the desperate need to win back his former wife, the faithless Lorna Sue, and a craving to test his erotic charms on every woman he meets.<br><br>But there are complications, including Lorna Sue's brother, Herbie, with whom she has an all-too-close relationship, and the considerable charms of Chippering's new love, the attractive, and of course already married, Mrs. Robert Kooshof, who may at last satisfy Chippering's longing for intimacy.<br><br>In <i>Tomcat in Love</i>, Tim O'Brien takes on the battle of the sexes with astonishing results. By turns hilarious, outrageous, romantic, and deeply moving, this is one of the most talked about novels in years: a novel for this and every age.</p><p>To date, Tim O'Brien's novels have all shared common traits: his heroes hail from the Midwest, usually Minnesota; Vietnam figures prominently; and the stories he tells, though invested with mordant wit, are usually pretty grim. So an O'Brien fan coming to <i>Tomcat in Love</i> on the heels of his earlier novels can be forgiven for occasionally checking the name on the cover (and the photo on the dust jacket) just to be <i>sure</i> this is, indeed, the same Tim O'Brien who wrote <i>Going After Cacciato</i>, <i>The Things They Carried</i>, <i>If I Die in a Combat Zone</i>, and <i>In the Lake of the Woods</i>.<p> In <i>Tomcat in Love</i> O'Brien introduces us to a very different hero: "In summary, then, my circumstances were these. Something over forty-nine years of age. Recently divorced. Pursued. Prone to late-night weeping. Betrayed not once but threefold: by the girl of my dreams, by her Pilate of a brother, and by a Tampa real-estate tycoon whose name I have vowed never again to utter." Thomas H. Chippering, professor of linguistics, war hero, and sex magnet--in his own mind, at least, has recently lost his childhood sweetheart and wife of 20 years to another man, the Tampa magnate, and Lorna Sue's desertion has clearly unhinged him. He has taken to flying down to Tampa from Minnesota on weekends to spy on his ex-wife and plot revenge against her, the tycoon, and Lorna Sue's brother, Herbie, whom he blames for destroying his marriage. </p><p> Thomas, Lorna Sue, and Herbie go back a long way together, bound equally by ties of love, guilt, and suspicion. Dating from the afternoon young Herbie nailed an even younger Lorna Sue's hand to a makeshift cross, Thomas has occupied a kind of emotional no man's land between the two: "In my bleakest moods, when black gets blackest, I think of it as a high perversion: Herbie coveted his own sister. Which is a fact. The stone truth. He was in love with her. More generously, I will sometimes concede that it was not sexual love, or not entirely, and that Herbie was driven by the obsessions of a penitent, a torturer turned savior. Partly, too, I am quite certain that Herbie secretly associated me with his own guilt. I was present at the beginning. My backyard, my plywood, my green paint." </p><p> Chippering takes his revenge to hilarious lengths, starting with a purple leather bra and panties stuffed beneath the seat of the tycoon's car and escalating from there. But even as he attempts to wreak havoc in his ex-wife's life, he succeeds in laying ruin to his own. His self-proclaimed irresistibility to women gets him in hot water with both his female students and his administration; his obsession with Lorna Sue threatens his budding romance with Mrs. Robert Kooshof, a woman who loves him as his wife never did--and, oh yes, there's that little matter of the squad of Green Berets he crossed many years before in Vietnam who may or may not be hunting him down. </p><p> Once you get over the shock of this new, funny Tim O'Brien, traces of the writer you thought you knew begin to surface. Chippering might be a pompous, overbearing windbag, but you can't trust him any more than you did any of O'Brien's other earthier, equally unreliable narrators. In one breath, he tells us, "I must in good conscience point out that women find me attractive beyond words. And who on earth could blame them?" In the next he describes himself as resembling "a clean-shaven version of our sixteenth president." Half the fun of reading <i>Tomcat in Love</i> is trying to sort out just how much of what Thomas H. Chippering tells us is true. Stellar writing, a brilliant cast of characters, and a sly, surprising story that breaks your heart one minute and tickles your funny bone the next all make Tim O'Brien's first foray into the comic novel a resounding success. <i>--Alix Wilber</i></p>"<i>Tomcat in Love</i> is a wonderful novel, laugh-out-loud funny, one of the best books I've come across in years.

Most countries have enjoyed periods of sustained growth, while inequality is showing modest declines and the middle class is expanding. Dictatorships have been left behind, and all major political actors seem to have accepted the democratic process and the rule of law. Latin Americans have entered the digital world, routinely using the Internet and social media.</p><p>These new realities in Latin America call for a new introduction to its history and culture, which <em>Latin America at 200</em> amply provides. Taking a reader-friendly approach that focuses on the big picture and uses concrete examples, Phillip Berryman highlights what Latin Americans are doing to overcome extreme poverty and underdevelopment. He starts with issues facing cities, then considers agriculture and farming, business, the environment, inequality and class, race and ethnicity, gender, and religion. His survey of Latin American history leads into current issues in economics, politics and governance, and globalization. Berryman also acknowledges the ongoing challenges facing Latin Americans, especially crime and corruption, and the efforts being made to combat them. Based on decades of experience, research, and travel, as well as recent studies from the World Bank and other agencies, <em>Latin America at 200</em> will be essential both as a classroom text and as an introduction for general readers.</p></p><p>Phillip Berryman is a writer, translator, and teacher who worked in Panama and Central America for a dozen years in the 1960s and 1970s. His previous works include Liberation Theology, Stubborn Hope, and Religion in the Megacity."A brilliant book, by far the best of its kind on Latin America. Its emphasis on how Latin America has changed in recent decades fills a yawning gap. This book is ideal for teaching because teaching, I am certain, was its genesis. Students will love it." (John Charles Chasteen, Professor of Latin American History, University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, and author of Born in Blood and Fire: A Concise History of Latin America and Americanos: Latin America&#x2019;s Struggle for Independence)<br><br>"Phillip Berryman&#x2019;s penetrating and lively book offers a kaleidoscopic perspective on Latin America as it enters its third century of independence. With something to offer both specialists and those just beginning to study the region, the book takes on the challenges of culture and globalization&#x2014;from agriculture to religion to changing gender roles." (June Carolyn Erlick, editor-in-chief, ReVista, the Harvard Review of Latin America)</p><h2>The Translation of Dr. Apelles (Vintage Contemporaries)</h2><p>Dr. Apelles, a translator of ancient texts, has made an unsettling discovery: a manuscript that has languished for years, written in a language that only he speaks. Moving back and forth between the scholar and his text, from a lone man in a labyrinthine archive to a pair of beautiful young Indian lovers in an unspoiled and snowy woodland, David Treuer weaves together two love stories. Enthralling and suspenseful, <i>The Translation of Dr. Apelles </i>dares to redefine the Native American novel.</p><p>David Treuer is an Ojibwe Indian from Leech Lake Reservation in northern Minnesota. He is the recipient of a Fulbright Fellowship to Canada, a Pushcart Prize, the 1996 Minnesota Book Award and was a finalist for the Penn West prize in 1999. <i>The Translation of Dr Apelles </i>is his third novel. He divides his time between his home on the Leech Lake Reservation and Minneapolis.DR. APELLES<br>1. From an early age, from the time Bimaadiz was fi ve or six, upon watching the men prepare to hunt, he would set up a piteous wail until Jiigibiig - not without some embarrassment - fi tted him with his own set of snowshoes made just for him and told him to follow along. Once in the bush he quieted down and never once scared the game by making noise and never once ruined the hunt by urinating when the wind might blow the scent toward the game. He was happy only when he was in the woods - and so, since Jiigibiig and Zhookaagiizhigookwe only wanted Bimaadiz to be happy, they let him go hunting at his pleasure. By the time he turned sixteen (and the time at which our story really begins), he was such an accomplished hunter he single - handedly supplied the village with most of the meat it needed. Such was his skill and care that Jiigibiig let the youngster use the Winchester repeating rifl e. Bimaadiz didn't need more than one shot, unless there was more than one deer or moose, but it was an honor to carry it. Jiigibiig and Zhookaagiizhigookwe, and those who remembered how he was found, suspected his power was the result of his contact with the cow moose during his infancy. Once, after hearing Bimaadiz shoot, Jiigibiig walked back into the woods with a sled to help him haul out his catch (for he was sure to have killed something, no doubt there was meat cooling on the ground), and he saw Bimaadiz kneeling over a dead moose, singing gently to the animal as he skinned it. It sounded like a lullaby, not a victory song, and the way Bimaadiz skinned the animal made the scene seem more like a birth than butchery. Because of the nimbus of affection surrounding him and because of the gifts given to him by his fi rst mother and the milk he received from his second mother, the moose, Bimaadiz grew into a singular young man. He was tall and strong but not thick; his body was supple and slender, with wide shoulders and very long fi ngers. His waist was narrow, but like a coiled spring - full of potential strength. His black hair was thick and smooth and he kept it cut short and parted in the middle, slicked down with hair oil. All the girls, even the older women, gasped when he walked by. It was a good life at Agencytown in those years; meat was never so plentiful and everyone loved the quiet hunter who provided for them so well.<br><br>2. Eta had grown up, too. She alone, perhaps, possessed more beauty than Bimaadiz did. She was tall for her age, and though not fi ne boned, she was lean and strong. Yet she had delicate fi ngers, and straight black hair that was always in two braids that hung down to her lower back. Her waist was narrow and her breasts, in advance of her years, were round and fi rm. All the boys and all the men sighed when she walked past. Her skin was smooth, clear, coppery, and healthy year round, except on her left cheek there was a dark round mark, very faint, that looked as though it had been left there when the wolf who had suckled her had kissed her cheek with her nose. It was really only a birthmark, it had been there before the she - wolf nosed the infant, but Aantti and Mary liked to think the wolf had left its mark. It seemed to the villagers that Eta had acquired some of the wolf's characteristics: she was incredibly intelligent, patient, concerned for others, and serious when anyone was looking, but silly and girl - like when she thought she was unobserved. Aantti and Mary were overjoyed at the unexpected gift of a daughter, especially since they thought they would never have one of their own. And so, being the object of so much happiness, Eta grew up receiving happiness. Her parents doted on her and gave her whatever it was that she wanted. They didn't have much to give - a poor sawyer and his Indian wife. Buttons, a bit of cloth, these were her toys. But all the same, the girl didn't want much. And she worked hard. Once her mother saw her hanging off the pump handle, her feet off the ground, as she tried to fi ll the water bucket. She helped her mother in all things - fetching water, wrapping big blue stem with wiigoob to make brooms and whisks. The thing she really wanted was to accompany her mother on the trapline, and this from even before she could walk properly. Mary bundled her in furs and placed her in the toboggan along with the snares and mink bait and set off for the string of lean - tos and temporary shelters along their trapping grounds. Mary never had to worry that Eta would struggle out of her wrappings or cry with impatience or trample the clean trails where she set the snares for rabbit and fox. Eta stayed in the toboggan, and as long as she could see above the tumble of tools and furs and watch Mary's hands at work, she was happy. Even when she was teething, all her mother had to do, upon fi nding a rabbit in a snare, was cut off the lower leg and hand it to Eta for her to chew on - the fl esh was so tough and cold, so laced with tendons that the rubbery texture soothed Eta's gums and she did not cry and sat quietly and observed Mary's broad back in front of the heavily loaded toboggan. As soon as she could walk, Eta followed behind the toboggan. Sometimes Mary pulled out of sight because Eta was still a small child and could not keep up, but all she had to do was follow the marks left by the toboggan and she would catch up eventually. By the time she was six years old she was setting all the rabbit snares herself. They never ate so many rabbits as when Eta set her snares. She secured them at just the right height and was so adept at matching the color of the snare to its surroundings that even a creature as suspicious as a rabbit could not see it. Mary said nothing about why she thought Eta was such a good trapper, but she suspected it was a result of her contact with the she - wolf, a benefi t of the wolf's milk. By the time Eta was twelve years old (and the point at which our story starts), she had taken over all the trapping. Mary could stay in the village and found much relief in her daughter's abilities; Mary was getting old and trapping had become diffi cult. For Eta trapping was as easy as breathing. She loaded the sled herself and, sometimes with a team of dogs pulling the sled, sometimes pulling it herself, set off for weeks at a time. When she came back the sled would always be full of fur - beaver, mink, martin, fi sher, weasel, bobcat, lynx - and loaded with meat too because sometimes she did some hunting on the side. Aantti was so pleased he gave her his puukko, the only possession that remained with him that he had taken from Finland. It had been his father's and the curved steel blade was perfect for skinning. Eta kept it sharp and made sure it never rusted. Who could hope for a better child? Skilled, earnest, respectful, concerned only for her parents and the animals she trapped. Her parents' only worry was about her beauty. She was so beautiful she caused everyone near her to shudder with longing, to stand up straight, to talk loudly in voices meant for her to hear. Some of them bragged about what they'd caught in their traps. But this only made her ignore them all the more. Eta loved the animals she trapped and took care to put their carcasses where the dogs would not ravage them. She brushed their fur before she sold them, conscious always of the life the animals were bestowing on her family. To brag about killing them was beneath her contempt. So, for the time being, Aantti and Mary put their worries aside. Eta seemed to be safe from the dangers of desire.<br><br>3. Bimaadiz had one other interest other than hunting and that was Eta. As for the beautiful girl, Bimaadiz was as precious to her as the animals she trapped. From an early age Bimaadiz's hunting and Eta's trapping had brought them together since his hunting grounds and her trapline overlapped. Bimaadiz, drawing out the fi rst syllable of her name, would say &#x201c;Eh - taa&#x201d; - and shyly, in response, she would elongate the second syllable of his name, saying Bi - maaa - diz&#x201d; - and so they had a special of addressing each other and took the greatest pleasure in each other's company. Bimaadiz would tell Eta where he had seen some rich fox runs and so, on his advice, Eta would hang her snares there to catch them. For her part, upon seeing moose tracks around an isolated slough, she would inform Bimaadiz and, sure enough, a few days later he would have killed a fat cow and a tender calf, enough to feed to the whole village for a week. They were such good friends that he would save the tongue for her and her parents. And having caught a fawn in one her snares, she tanned the hide and sewed it into a bandolier bag for Bimaadiz to keep his shells and food in. When she was sick, he would check her traps for her, and she would kill some game for him when he had other chores to do around Agencytown and could not get out into the woods. But they were children after all, and so their activities weren't always so serious. As a joke she made a doll out of marsh grass (having no cornhusks at that season to make a proper doll). She used the guard hairs from a fi sher for the doll's braids, and the broken trigger from a steel trap was used to represent his gun. All in all it was a good likeness of Bimaadiz. Seeing some deer tracks she set the doll on the trail where she knew Bimaadiz would fi nd it. Bimaadiz also made trinkets for his friend - toy snares only big enough for mice and hoops made from willow twigs for stretching them. This continued - their ideal friendship, their ideal life, until the spirits conspired to make things more diffi cult for the two. Dr Apelles looks back down at the manuscript. The bell will sound at any moment now. His translation has lodged itself deep in his consciousness. It, and another signifi cant question, continue to plague him. But now, it is no accident, his thoughts turn to the library - not this one, not the archive - in which he works. It is universally acknowledged that - in addition to the history of Charlemagne and of the printing press and also in addition to narratives told to us by a friend detailing the dreams of other friends of his whom we do not know - the description of a person's typical day at work is among the most boring kind of story in existence. However, since Dr Apelles' vacation in the country of his imagination, governed in part by the itinerary of the manuscript, which, it must be said, is also impossibly linked to his daily work, we must follow him to work and hear out the story of his days. The bell will ring soon. It should be said that the archive to which he goes every other Friday is, strictly speaking, not a library, and neither is the building in which he works the other nine days out of the fortnight. Those days, the nine days (not counting holidays and weekends) out of fourteen that form the architecture of his life if not the action (though this will change), are spent at RECAP, which, as we have said, is a library but also is not a library. Since, if it isn't apparent yet, RECAP is a place where books are captured, tagged, and then withheld from - not released into - the general population of other books; where, to put it another way, books are forced into a system designed to keep track of how they are forgotten; that is, designed to give structure and meaning to ignorance and anonymity; to create a special place for books that haven't been read or if they have, not often enough; all of this is to say that, contrary to what we have come to expect from stories such as this - the forgotten or unknown or undervalued or obsolete signifi cance of Dr Apelles' works and days - the dusty corners of his life, if his life were a house (and if it were we would expect to fi nd it represented by, signifi ed by, a single dusty houseplant, an umbrella, or a shoe tree at best, and an empty fl ower pot, a persistent water ring on the fl oor, and a broken bit of string, at worst), is where we should begin looking at the no longer dreary dream of Dr Apelles' days. He had long been settled in apartment 33 J. Long enough to have begun to feel as though he owned the place. He was well thought of in the neighborhood of the other apartments. Having lived there for so long, he possessed a remarkable amount of information about his neighbors: their ages and ailments, the progressive ages of their children, their various and varied occupations and so on. Most of all, he was quite good at remembering names. And so, when in conversation with his neighbors they always felt, given Dr Apelles' polite and thoroughly informed interest, that his portraits of them, of their public and semi - public virtues, were such accurate and pleasing likenesses that he was, as far as they were concerned, the perfect neighbor. In short, he flattered them, but not intentionally.</p><h2>Marine Invertebrates of the Pacific Northwest: With Additions and Corrections</h2><p>Now available in a paperback edition, updated with 30 pages of additions and corrections, this work provides a systematic treatment of almost every group of marine invertebrates of the Pacific Northwest.

Then the miraculous happens - a mortar strikes the prison and he is free! <br>Old, frail, and injured, he escapes to the jungle, where he encounters two Western journalists and a beautiful freelance photographer taking refuge from the carnage.

Boy, does it deliver.<br>&#x2015;<b><i><i>Bookreporter.com</i></i></b><br><br>Nelson DeMille is at the absolute peak of his powers in "The Quest" (Center Street, 464 pages, $26) an epic tale that's broad in both scope and vision, harkening back to his earlier masterworks such as "The Charm School" and "By the Rivers of Babylon" as it brings the action in Africa of the mid-1970s. That's where an old priest named Father Armando emerges from a bombed-out prison after decades in captivity with the location of nothing less than the Holy Grail tucked in his mind.<br><br>From there, staged against the backdrop of the endless Ethiopian civil war, the quest of the title begins in search of it, undertaken by a trio of intrepid journalists (well, two plus a photographer), including the hard-bitten and hard-driving Frank Purcell, who's standing in for DeMille's redoubtable John Corey this time out. Purcell becomes our Robert Langdon as the book takes on the texture and feel of Dan Brown at his level best, chock full of mysticism, murderous monks, deadly assassins, and vengeful natives all on a quest to either find the Grail or make sure its secrets remain hidden forever.<br><br>This is adventure on the grandest of scales and richest of tapestries, Wilbur Smith and Fredrick Forsythe rolled into one with some Indian Jones tossed in for good measure.

The word has found its way into our consciousness accompanied by ideas of healing, sharing emotion and pain. Empaths are sensitive, caring, responsive people who have at the core of their nature an innate ability to receive energy, information and awareness from others with a depth and intensity that is beyond our customary understanding of empathy. Yet, this very receptivity and permeability brings its own challenges. It is vital for empaths to recognize themselves as such and to consciously explore, understand and address this energetic flow in their life. Self-inquiry is the essential tool to understanding all that motivates and colors your experience of the world. The book explores in depth this receptivity, as well as tools, concepts and approaches to support understanding and how to flourish with this heightened sensitivity. This book is a shared journey, edited from the sharing of participants in years of workshops and sessions with Elisabeth Fitzhugh and the Orion group. Dancers Between Realms was one of the first books to offer insight into living as a sensitive receptive person and continues to be a vital voice of understanding and support.</p><p>'Empaths are Dancers Between Realms - <br>carrying a quiet song of <br>receptivity and responsiveness <br>in a world that can be <br>loud, harsh and insensitive.'Elisabeth Y.

Randy Woodley, a Keetowah Cherokee, casts a biblical, multiethnic vision for people of every nation, tribe and tongue. He carefully unpacks how Christians should think about racial and cultural identity, demonstrating that ethnically diverse communities have always been God&#39;s intent for his people. Woodley gives practical insights for how we can relate to one another with sensitivity, contextualize the gospel, combat the subtleties of racism, and honor one another&#39;s unique contributions to church and society. Along the way, he reckons with difficult challenges from our racially painful history and offers hope for healing and restoration. With profound wisdom from his own Native American heritage and experience, Woodley&#39;s voice adds a distinctive perspective to contemporary discussions of racial reconciliation and multiethnicity. Here is a biblical vision for unity in diversity.</p><p>"Living in Color is an excellent book. Written by one of the most trusted, wise and fruitful Native American leaders of our generation, it leads us on a journey of discovery through Scripture in order to see how God gives us identity in today's multicultural world." from the foreword by John Dawson, author, Healing America's Wounds <p>"Living in Color strikes a chord that should resonate in the spirit of every believer, to love and appreciate one another in the midst of the amazing diversity that is the body of Christ."

Her images are both figurative and abstract; she works in both black-and-white and color. Animals figure prominently in her work, as do dream figures and the artist herself in various manifestations. Oftentimes her images relate journeys she has taken, either on this earth or in waking or sleeping dreams. Many times, her paintings are accompanied by her own telling of these stories, and as a writer, Craighead has the ability to move us as deeply as her images do. <br> <br> This retrospective conveys Craighead's enormous body of work over the past forty years. It is a tribute to an important visionary, a fine artist, and an inspiring life. Essays by Rosemary Davies, a writer who first met Craighead at Stanbrook Abbey; Virginia Beane Rutter, a Jungian analyst and the author of Embracing Persephone and Celebrating Girls; and Eugenia Parry, an art historian and the author of numerous books and essays about art and photography, discuss Meinrad Craighead's work with subtlety and insight. <br> 352 pages, smythe-sewn casebound book, with jacket.

Demand for these edible jewels is growing among those keen to feast on the South's natural pleasures, whether gathered in the wild or cultivated with care. Indigenous fruits here include blackberries, mayhaws, muscadine and scuppernong grapes, pawpaws, persimmons, and strawberries. From old-school Grape Hull Pie to Mayhaw Jelly&#x2013;Glazed Shrimp, McDermott's recipes for these less common fruits are of remarkable interest--and incredibly tasty.

During the Cretan revolt of 1897 his family was sent to the island of Naxos, where he attended the French School of the Holy Cross. From 1902 to 1906 he studied law at Athens University. He worked first as a journalist and throughout a long career wrote several plays, travel journals and translations. His remarkable travels began in 1907 and there were few countries in Europe or Asia that he didn&#39;t visit. He studied Buddhism in Vienna and later belonged to a group of radical intellectuals in Berlin, where he began his great epic The Odyssey, which he completed in 1938. He didn&#39;t start writing novels until he was almost 60 and completed his most famous work, Zorba the Greek, in 1946. Other novels include Freedom and Death (1953) and The Last Temptation (1954), which the Vatican placed on the Index.

In the summer of 1969, Roberta Price, a recent college graduate, secured a grant to visit these communities and photograph them. When she and her lover David arrived at Libre in the Huerfano Valley of southern Colorado, they were so taken with what they found that they wanted to participate instead of observe. The following spring they married, dropped out of graduate school in upstate New York, packed their belongings into a 1947 Chrysler Windsor Coupe, and moved to Libre, leaving family and academia behind.<br><br>Huerfano is Price's captivating memoir of the seven years she spent in the Huerfano ("Orphan") Valley when it was a petrie dish of countercultural experiments. She and David joined with fellow baby boomers in learning to mix cement, strip logs, weave rugs, tan leather, grow marijuana, build houses, fix cars, give birth, and make cheese, beer, and furniture as well as poetry, art, music, and love. They built a house around a boulder high on a ridge overlooking the valley and made ends meet by growing their own food, selling homemade goods, and hiring themselves out as day laborers. Over time their collective ranks swelled to more than three hundred, only to diminish again as, for many participants, the dream of a life of unbridled possibility gradually yielded to the hard realities of a life of voluntary poverty.<br><br>Price tells her story with a clear, distinctive voice, documenting her experiences with photos as well as words. Placing her story in the larger context of the times, she describes her participation in the antiwar movement, the advent of the women's movement, and her encounters with such icons as Ken Kesey, Gary Snyder, Abbie Hoffman, Stewart Brand, Allen Ginsburg, and Baba Ram Dass.<br><br>At once comic, poignant, and above all honest, <i>Huerfano</i> recaptures the sense of affirmation and experimentation that fueled the counterculture without lapsing into nostalgic sentimentality on the one hand or cynicism on the other.</p><p>Selected by ForeWord magazine as one of the top ten university press books of the year."A wonderful memoir of learning, doing, sharing, and loving. . . . The sunshine of this book is in the telling: humorous, resonant, occasionally pained, but always life-embracing."--ForeWord <p>"For many people a road not taken that is fascinating to read about. . . . Libre was no utopia, but its members were committed and it felt more like family than the nuclear kind. . . . Sweet children, with a sweet, sweet dream."--Los Angeles Times Book Review </p><p>"I like this book. I like its attention to detail, its honesty, and the author's clear distinctive voice. . . . More than a tale of communes and hippies, Huerfano is a classic coming-of-age story, in which a young woman learns life's lessons, one by one."--The Santa Fe New Mexican </p><p>"Roberta Price's book captures the moral fervor, the enormous amount of work, the sexual explorations, and the personal growth curve of one very smart, very attractive, highly educated woman who 'threw it all away' (as her parents might have said) to found an alternative community in the mountains of Colorado. . . . This is a very very good book and deserves a wide audience."--Peter Coyote, actor and author of "Sleeping Where I Fall: A Chronicle" </p><p>"A splendid book that beautifully captures the spirit of the moment, and it does so in the best possible way-by recollecting and working through the specific details so often lost to memory and history. Huerfano is a virtual archive of data-an early edition of The Whole Earth Catalog come with a compelling narrative and vivid characters."--Nick Bromell, author of "Tomorrow Never Knows: Rock and Psychedelics in the 1960s" - "An impressive and important book. There is a paucity of good literature on the commune movement of the '60s and '70s, and much stereotypic misrepresentation of the counterculture. What Price's memoir reminds us is that the counterculture was intensely political, although the politics were personal as well as national."-Alexander Bloom, coeditor of "Takin' It to the Streets": A Sixties Reader</p></p><h2>Build the Micro-Stim: Use Microcurrent Therapy to Heal Yourself</h2><p>Microcurrent therapy is the use of an extremely small pulsating current of electricity to treat pain and to stimulate healing in the body. These currents are on the same scale as the currents produced by the body on its own. This means you cannot feel them because they are below the level of sensory perception. Doctors and physical therapists are using microcurrent therapy to reduce pain and promote faster healing of wounds, injured muscles, tendons, and broken bones. There is enormous potential in the possibility that this type of therapy can eliminate many viruses in the blood. It may also have a similar effect on bacteria, fungi, and parasites. In effect, it may be possible to apply this technology (through the Micro-Stim) as a &#34;Blood Purifier.&#34; The Micro-Stim is a device that is capable of introducing a microcurrent into the body. It then monitors this current through a numerical display. As the body&#39;s electrical resistance changes, the amount of current flowing through it changes.</p><p></p><h2>Moorish Spain</h2><p>Written in the same tradition as John Julius Norwich&#39;s engrossing accounts of Venice and Byzantium, Richard Fletcher&#39;s Moorish Spain entertains even as it enlightens. He tells the story of a vital period in Spanish history which transformed the culture and society, not only of Spain, but of the rest of Europe as well. Moorish influence transformed the architecture, art, literature and learning and Fletcher combines this analysis with a crisp account of the wars, politics and sociological changes of the time. &#39;Richard Fletcher makes a winding and wonderfully evocative journey through Spanish history...His mastery of his sources is hardly less remarkable than his vivid, almost physical grasp of the Spain he describes&#39; The Economist</p><p>Richard Fletcher is a specialist in medieval history and teaches at the University of York. He is a fellow fo the Royal Historical Society.Fletcher, author of the well-received The Quest for El Cid ( LJ 3/1/90), intends his new work to be an introduction to the culture and history of Moorish Spain. He has written for the traveler who wants more background than the average guidebook provides or for anyone who wants a thoroughgoing overview of the subject. Fletcher uses translations from Moorish poetry and historical anecdotes to illuminate a significant period in European history, arguing that Moorish Spain acted as a channel through which the philosophical and scientific works of the Islamic world passed to European Christendom. One example given by Fletcher is the development of Thomist philosophy, which sought to reconcile revelation and reason. The Moorish philosopher Averroes, whose treatises on Aristotle had attempted such a reconciliation of philosophy and religion in an Islamic context, was cited by St. Thomas Aquinas 503 times.

You will not find here descriptions of popular uprising, armed resistance, or political negotiations, despite these of course forming an integral and necessary part of any radical political transformation.

Against an architectural history of decolonization that sought to reuse colonial architecture for the same purpose for which it was originally built, DAAR sees opportunities in a set of playful propositions for the subversion, reuse, profanation, and recycling of these structures of domination and the legal infrastructures that sustain them.</p><p>DAAR's projects should be understood as a series of architectural fables set in different locations: an abandoned military base near Beit Sahour, the refugee camp of Dheisheh in Bethlehem, the remnants of three houses on the Jaffa beach, the uncompleted Palestinian Parliament building, the historical village of Battir, the village of Miska destroyed during the Nakba, and the red-roofed West Bank colony of Jabel Tawil (P'sagot) next to Ramallah-El Bireh.</p></p><p>Eyal Weizman is Professor of Spatial and Visual Cultures at Goldsmiths College, University of London and a Global Scholar at Princeton University.

Two fallen angels (Matt Damon and Ben Affleck), sentenced to eternal exile in Wisconsin, are trying to get back into heaven. A renegade cardinal in New Jersey (George Carlin), as part of his &#34;Catholicism Wow!&#34; campaign, has opened a loophole in Catholic doctrine that would give them their opportunity-and, in proving God&#39;s judgment wrong, destroy the universe. An abortion clinic counselor (Linda Fiorentino) who may or may not be of holy bloodlines is tapped as the very reluctant savior-and, accompanied by the thirteenth apostle (Chris Rock), a wayward muse (Salma Hayek), and two very questionable prophets (Jason Mewes and Kevin Smith, AKA Jay and Silent Bob), she sets off on a mission to save the world.</p><p></p><h2>Advanced Studies of the Human Aura: How to Charge Your Energy Field with Light and Spiritual Radiance</h2><p>Advanced Studies of the Human Aura takes studies of the aura to an exciting new level.

As he navigates this quirky and occasionally hilarious subculture, Stone pulls back the curtain on a community shrouded in secrecy, fueled by obsession and brilliance, and organized around a single overriding need: to prove one's worth by deceiving others.</p> <p>But his journey is more than a tale of tricks, gigs, and geeks. In trying to understand how expert magicians manipulate our minds to create their astonishing illusions, Stone uncovers a wealth of insight into human nature and the nature of perception. Every turn leads to questions about how the mind perceives the world and processes everyday experiences. By investigating some of the lesser-known corners of psychology, neuroscience, physics, history, and even crime, all through the lens of trickery and illusion, <em>Fooling Houdini</em> arrives at a host of startling revelations about how the mind works&#x2014;and why, sometimes, it doesn't.</p></p><h2>The Twelve Lives of Samuel Hawley: A Novel</h2><p><b>&#x201c;A gripping American-on-the-run thriller . . . a brilliant coming-of-age tale and a touching exploration of father-daughter relationships.&#x201d;&#x2014;<i>Newsweek</i></b><br> &nbsp;<br> <b>&#x201c;One part Quentin Tarantino, one part Scheherazade, and twelve parts wild innovation.&#x201d;&#x2014;Ann Patchett, #1 <i>New York Times </i>bestselling&nbsp;author of <i>Commonwealth</i></b><br><br><b>NATIONAL BESTSELLER � NAMED ONE OF THE BEST BOOKS OF THE YEAR BY NPR � <i>The Washington Post&nbsp;</i><b>�&nbsp;<i>Paste&nbsp;</i></b></b><br><br>Samuel Hawley isn&#x2019;t like the other fathers in Olympus, Massachusetts.

Yet, if we are honest, most of us have a tendency to stick with the parts of the Bible that we understand or are comforted by, leaving vast tracts of Scripture unexplored. Even when following a guide, we may never reach into the Bible's less-traveled regions -- passages marked by violence, tragedy, offense, or obscurity.<br><br> What our modern minds shy away from, however, ancient, medieval, and Reformation commentators dove into. In fact, their writings often display strikingly contemporary interests and sensitivities to the meaning and moral implications of the Bible's difficult narratives. John Thompson here presents nine case studies in the history of exegesis -- including the stories of Hagar and Jephthah's daughter, the imprecatory psalms, and texts that address domestic relations, particularly divorce -- in order to demonstrate the valuable insights into Scripture that we can gain not only from what individual commentators say but from fifteen centuries' cumulative witness to the meaning of Scripture in the life of the church.<br><br> Visit Dr. Thompson's companion website at: http://purl.oclc.org/net/jlt/exegesis so access further features such as a list of commentary literature in English through the year 1700 and sample sermons that model a homiletic use of the history of interpretation.</p><p>John L Thompson is Professor of Historical Theology and Gaylen and Susan Byker Professor of Reformed Theology at Fuller Theological Seminary.<b><i>Christian Century</i></b><br> "Thompson demonstrates that earlier generations struggled with questions not unlike our own and that they have much to teach us about faithful interpretation of scripture. A delightful read."<br><br><b><i>Interpretation</i></b><br> "Preachers will want to keep this book close at hand; it will impel them to investigate the riches of the history of exegesis also for texts they preach more often."<br><br><b>Richard B. Hays</b><br> &#x2014; Duke Divinity School<br> "It is a peculiar conceit of modernity that we are the first to recognize the presence of puzzling, offensive texts in the Bible. John Thompson punctures that illusion and offers a fascinating survey of the diverse ways in which premodern interpreters struggled &#x2014; for better and for worse &#x2014; with some of the same texts that trouble us today.&nbsp;<i>Reading the Bible with the Dead</i>&nbsp;contains a treasure trove of provocative insights. The clarity of Thompson's exposition is exemplary, and his evaluations are wise and balanced. The 'Finding Guide to English Translations of Commentary Literature Written before 1600' will be of great value to students and pastors who want to pursue this conversation more deeply."<br><br><b>Timothy George</b><br> &#x2014; Beeson Divinity School<br> "Combining mature scholarship with an engaging style, John Thompson helps us to peer over the shoulders of saints of the past as we read the Bible today, especially some of its difficult texts. In doing so, he shows that serious study of Holy Scripture requires more than the latest Bible translation in one hand and the latest commentary in the other. An invaluable guide for all pastors and teachers of God's Word."<br><br><b><i>Jesus Creed</i></b><br> "Every pastor or church needs a book like this in the library."<br><br><b>Elsie McKee</b><br> &#x2014; Princeton Theological Seminary<br> "John Thompson is well known for his fascinating scholarly studies of the history of exegesis, particularly concerning some of the more challenging biblical texts on issues of gender and violence that lectionaries often skip. . . In this clear and user-friendly book Thompson melds modern questions with patristic, medieval, and Reformation-era questionings about hard-to handle biblical stories and injunctions, from Hagar and Jephthah's daughter to the psalms of imprecation and Pauline strictures on men's hair and women's public speaking. While making no claims to exhaustive treatment of any text, Thompson provides twenty-first-century readers with a rich spectrum of interpretation by pre-Enlightenment exegetes. "<br><br><b>Mark Labberton</b><br> &#x2014; senior pastor of First Presbyterian Church of Berkeley<br> "Thompson's book provides an exceptionally incisive and courageous example of reading uncomfortable biblical texts through a history of the reading of those texts. The fruit it bears is faithful wisdom, the kind of reading we need most."<br><br><b>Kathryn Greene-McCreight</b><br> &#x2014; author of&nbsp;<i>Darkness Is My Only Companion</i><br> "A bold encounter with the 'texts of terror.'. . .

Meanwhile, he's been slowly eating his way through the bag of mangos he bought for a dollar on the corner, watching the people come and go, reminding him of ants. By now, he's sucked the juice from half of the mangoes. He's cloyed with the sweetness of the fruit, his hands are sticky, and he's desperately tired. He hasn't slept in two weeks, ever since he promised his mother on her deathbed he'd stop drinking. Maybe he's been waiting for the call here rather than in the streets by the courthouse because, close to the church, something might come along to solve his problems, some divine intervention perhaps. In his shirt pocket he's got an image of St. Expeditus right next to his cell. When the phone finally rings he ignores the sound and continues sucking. With four dead bodies and no arrest, Sal�m ought to build him a monument. He didn't want to kill her, the judge, not over a land dispute with a drug kingpin rotting in jail. During one of his sleepless nights he'd heard a psychoanalyst on the radio telling how men who mistreat women have homosexual tendencies. He doesn't want to be remembered as a faggot as well as a murderer. He stands up and walks toward the door of the Basilica, which is unusually packed.</em></p> <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "What's going on here?" he asks a shoeshine boy. He's short of breath and sounds like an asthmatic dog.</em></p> <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "The Jericho pilgrimage," the boy says, knocking twice on the tip of the man's shoe.</em></p> <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Richard Zambrano looks at the boy. He puts one foot on top of the case full of cans of polish and dirty flannel cloths, while drying his sticky hands on his pants.

Richard asks.</em></p> <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "It starts here and ends there." The shoeshine boy points toward El Panecillo, the bread loaf hill topped with a statue of the Virgin. "They say you get two wishes if you make it all the way up."</em></p> <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Yeah?" the man says, interested.</em></p> <p><em>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The boy nods and taps the tip of the shoe again. The man switches feet. When the boy is done, Richard tosses a fifty centavo coin in the air and takes off running after the pilgrims. <br> </em></p> <p><em>&nbsp;</em></p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>PART ONE: THE COOPERATIVE OF POSO WELLS</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ol> <li>The Candidate</li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Poso Wells does not appear on any map. How could it? The last time anyone did a topographical survey, that enormous mass of mud dredged from the estuary was still part of the river. And water flows. It's not subdivided into lots. But there lies Poso Wells, objections be damned. If you were to ask any of its residents for a precise description of its location, they might tell you it's the most stinking, forgotten hole on this side of the Pacific. Kilometers and kilometers of houses built out of sticks and reeds held together by a mix of mud and stones, all resting on a suspension of sewage and moldy clay. Mangrove posts sunk into soft, unstable soil perforated by every tide or current that sweeps high-tonnage ships toward the port of Guayaquil. But if that answer didn't satisfy you, and you were to press on with, "But what street do I take, what corner do I turn, from the Beltway do I head north or south?" then most likely you'd be told to go to hell, and your respondent might mutter under her breath that anyone's idea of hell on a bad day would look a lot like Poso Wells. It's in the mouth of the fucking devil, if you really want to know.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And yet, though no one who didn';t live there would venture within a hundred yards of that place, when campaign time rolls around it suddenly turns into an electoral battlefield -- because there are hundreds of thousands of votes to be had. Every inhabitant needs something, and offers come raining down. Especially housing. Houses are promised in exchange for votes, as are construction materials and building loans. Stages are erected, loudspeakers are hung, and along come the girls, immodestly clothed teenagers who have to be escorted by bodyguards because everyone wants a piece of them. Hundreds of thousands of hands, like tentacles, try to touch them on their way in. But once on stage, that sensation of being mauled fades away. The plaza is electrifying. The girls quickly forget that without the bodyguards, if the stage were to collapse, none of them would survive. They'd be lost in the labyrinthine twist and turns of the barrio, destroyed, only bits and pieces of them to be found. But not this time. Every four years, or sometimes every two, television crews descend on the barrio. Trucks full of cables and satellite dishes arrive. An entire brigade of national police is deployed while a city tractor fixes the roads, or at least fills them with enough dirt from the nearby Santa Elena peninsula to allow the entry of the candidates and their vehicles full of boosters. In Poso Wells such gatherings always take place on a particular vacant lot, an enormous abandoned rectangle situated in the third phase of the Cooperative, the third part, historically speaking, to be occupied by a wave of settlers. Nobody, in twenty-some years of democracy enacted via repeated election campaigns, has stopped to ask why no houses have been built on this lot, why it doesn&#x2019;t even serve as a sandlot for sports, while elsewhere in the barrio any vacant expanse is invaded by squatters, one lot after another, by settlers who risk their lives to build on top of garbage that still has only the flimsiest hold on the riverbed. Why, even though this lot is surrounded by the only lampposts in all of Poso Wells, does no one ever gather there except at campaign time?</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The answer is not very interesting -- and even less so for those who are charged with the task of covering the news. Those who live in the Cooperative know that something isn't right, but they are not likely to explain. If forced to say what it is about this particular patch of sterile and cursed ground, they couldn't. They simply know, everyone knows, that certain parcels must be avoided. Because all over the barrio, things disappear. A bunch of bananas can't be left outside the door, because it will vanish. It has to be safeguarded inside the house, though padlocks are not much use either. Something crouches in the streets of Poso Wells, and it attacks the nerves like a persistent drumbeat. Whatever it is lurks in the residents' dreams, pants in their faces, slobbers them with noxious saliva and septic-tank breath, leaving their bodies sticky and dirty when they wake up. This sensation of danger cannot be shaken off by a mere act of will. The residents live with it all day long. In the evening it just becomes more palpable, because what vanishes then is not just food. People disappear too.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; At campaign time, the threat diminishes. There are too many electric wires, too many workers, too much equipment turning everything upside down. The music reverberates as the girls dance their way through choreographed moves again and again, though they've been selected for their looks, not their skill. They put on their best faces for the cameras and smile.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In 2006, the campaign has sharpened in Poso Wells. The first round is over and the winner, who has edged his opponent by four percentage points, needs to make the next encounter with the electorate more spectacular than the one before. He arrives in a chartered helicopter under the last rays of the late-afternoon sun. The light is diaphanous, ethereal, seemingly infinite as it reflects off the shell of the craft. The occupant is as eye-catching as the machine that brings him: Chinese silk guayabera, creamy linen pants that flutter around his gym-toned legs, iguana-skin shoes custom-made in Italy. Long, curly hair falls to his shoulders and down his back, while prominent cheekbones accent his rugged face. His movements are graceful, in the way of those favored by divine providence or an overstuffed bank account. He isn't tall, but on the stage he'll look enormous. He'll offer to fulfill desires and confer salvation. This time, like every time, he has ordered sacks of cornmeal and flour to be distributed, along with containers filled with lard. While he's still hovering over the cityscape, his boosters distribute these gifts in the plaza. That's why a crowd has piled into the space cleared for the helicopter to land, and now the pilot doesn't know what to do. The candidate sweats, prodigiously, soaking his clothes, tracing a design of wispy wings down the back of his guayabera while he wipes his face with an impeccable handkerchief. In his rear trouser pocket he has six more of these in reserve. Before boarding the copter, he fortified himself with two large bottles of beer and five glasses of whiskey, one after another, at the headquarters of his party. Now he needs to urinate. Desperately. But, flying over the vast spread of the barrio, he tries to forbear.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Motherfucking cunt, I can't hold it any more. Get those people out of the way!"</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "How?" the pilot asks..</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "Get down lower and give it a try" the candidate responds, barely moving his lips while sweat covers his eyes. "Where there's a will there's way." He takes a deep breath and repeats the adage like a mantra - "Where there's a will, there's a way" -- while the pilot nods and attacks the sea of bodies.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; But try as he might, no one moves. What do they care if the rotor blades cut off their heads? In the whirlwind, matchbook houses tremble and threaten to fall. The blades cut through TV antennas and pirate electrical wires. On the fourth try, the pilot swoops down close to the designated rectangle while lowering an aluminum ladder, the only way to deposit the candidate on the ground. Under the continuous rush of wind, seven houses perched on rotten posts collapse, accompanied by the crying of children and the screams of women, while husbands and boyfriends try to pull themselves and the women and children out of the rubble. But all of this can barely be heard as the loudspeakers saturate the atmosphere with decibels of sound. It's as if the doors of heaven had opened for celestial choirs and trumpet blasts, for all the angels of heaven to proclaim the second coming of the Lord. On stage, the girls shake their hips with frenetic, hypnotizing rhythm. The people shout, jump, sway, swing. No one can hear the protests of those who have just lost their homes. The candidate, his hands spread like a man on the cross, descends through space - the crush around him acts in his favor now - until he touches the earth where his waiting bodyguards surround him. From the viewpoint of the great mass of people, he seems to levitate as the bodyguards lift him bodily to the stage. That's when he realizes he has no place to discharge his bladder in peace. He sweats and sweats, with few options left. He is going to pee, and he's going to do it in front of the hundreds of inhabitants of Poso Wells. He'll be discreet, he'll allow a stream of urine to slide down his linen pants while he moves about the stage to avoid forming a puddle under his feet. In the heat, what his clothes absorb will evaporate quickly. The rest will slip though the gaps in the stage. While he struts about and waves to the acclaiming crowd, he puts this plan into action, until his boosters close around him in a great human chain and someone hands him a microphone. The electricity can be felt in the air. At this moment, he stops moving and the puddle at his feet takes on a certain depth. It wouldn't bother him, no one would notice it, really, except that he is holding a cable connected directly to one of the high-voltage streetlights, and he's standing in a pool of liquid.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Bad combination.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the wires explode and the lights go out -- the lights that the organizers of the event have stolen from the lampposts erected by the municipality a few months before -- the people see the candidate rise above the stage, encircled by a celestial halo. The glow shoots like lightning through all of his entourage.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Really, it's a sight to behold. Of a strange, extreme beauty. Extraordinarily so.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, a smell of meat on the grill. A stench of scorched flesh that permeates every square inch of the usually vacant lot.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And then, finally, pitch black.</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;</p> <ol> <li>Yesterday's papers</li> </ol> <p>&nbsp;</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; He came in search of clues for an article about the disappearances that happened months before. When he realized what a large and difficult task that was, he decided to meet with his editors and ask for more time to investigate and more inches for his story. The answer to both requests was no. All that had been reported on TV was that three or four people, all of them women, had disappeared near the island called Trinitaria in the so-called Cooperative of Poso Wells. It didn't take long for him to discover a lot more: that there was a pattern dating back at least fifteen years and the number of women who had disappeared was not four but nearly fifty. All this was buried in a tangle of legal problems and official neglect: reports never filed, no money to pursue them, dead ends, leads never followed up, priorities left unclear, migrants who went back where they had come from and left the names of daughters, wives, and nieces forgotten on the shores of the saltwater estuary. But now, in light of the latest events, everything that happened in Wells needed to be reconsidered.</p> <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Varas had managed to reconstruct those events,...</p></p><h2>Persons and Things</h2><p><p>Moving effortlessly between symbolist poetry and Barbie dolls, artificial intelligence and Kleist, Kant, and Winnicott, Barbara Johnson not only clarifies psychological and social dynamics; she also re-dramatizes the work of important tropes&#x2015;without ever losing sight of the ethical imperative with which she begins: the need to treat persons as persons.</p><p>In <i>Persons and Things</i>, Johnson turns deconstruction around to make a fundamental contribution to the new aesthetics. She begins with the most elementary thing we know: deconstruction calls attention to gaps and reveals that their claims upon us are fraudulent. Johnson revolutionizes the method by showing that the inanimate thing exposed as a delusion is central to fantasy life, that fantasy life, however deluded, should be taken seriously, and that although a work of art &#x201c;is formed around something missing,&#x201d; this &#x201c;void is its vanishing point, not its essence.&#x201d; She shows deftly and delicately that the void inside Keats&#x2019;s urn, Heidegger&#x2019;s jug, or Wallace Stevens&#x2019;s jar forms the center around which we tend to organize our worlds.</p><p>The new aesthetics should restore fluidities between persons and things. In pursuing it, Johnson calls upon Ovid, Keats, Poe, Plath, and others who have inhabited this in-between space. The entire process operates via a subtlety that only a critic of Johnson&#x2019;s caliber could reveal to us.</p></p><p>Barbara Johnson taught in the departments of English and Comparative Literature at Harvard University and was the Frederic Wertham Professor of Law and Psychiatry in Society. She is the author of <i>The Critical Difference</i>, <i>A World of Difference</i>, and <i>The Wake of Deconstruction</i>.&#x201c;<i>Persons and Things</i> secures Barbara Johnson's place as the most important literary critic of our day. This exhilaratingly intelligent book is an American grammatology of pop culture, advertisements, and political <br>rhetoric. Johnson provides lucid, even thrilling insights into the rhetorical framing of living subjects, legal persons, non-persons and things. Filled with the phantasmagoria of talking tombstones, babbling Barbies, puppets, pets, and golden calves, <i>Persons and Things</i> is a trove of cracklingly decoded insight. Never has text spoken so eloquently.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Patricia Williams, author of <i>Alchemy of Race and Rights</i> and <i>The Rooster's Egg</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Barbara Johnson's well earned reputation is for being a rare theorist who knows how to write. In <i>Persons and Things</i> she juggles like a pro as she throws Ovid, catches Keats, throws Marianne Moore, catches Francis Ponge, throws Kant, catches Winnicott so as to illuminate the relationship that humans have to things.

Our best defense, he claims, is a vibrant Catholic culture, and our best hope for creating it lies in the principles found in the <em>Catechism of the Catholic Church.</em></p><p> This book takes you on a masterful journey through the relevant portions of the Catechism, distilling sophisticated theological concepts into words that are simple, clear, and direct, while unpacking its core teachings on faith and morals that nurture true civilizations. In <em>Rebuilding Catholic Culture,</em> you'll also discover sensible ways to begin restoring Catholic culture -- right now -- in your own life and family, and in our larger communities as well: in the theater, the classroom, in our hospitals, and even in the public square. This profoundly accessible book will renew your confidence in the world-transforming character of our Creed and in the potency of our Faith to shape and redefine the culture of the West.</p></p><p><b>"Fr.

Dietz's acclaimed Legion of the Damned series...</b><br><br>There is one final choice for the hopeless&#x2014;the terminally ill, the condemned criminals, the victims who cannot be saved: becoming cyborg soldiers in the Legion. Their human bodies are destroyed and they are reborn as living weapons. But when aliens attack the Empire, the Legion must choose sides.</p><p><b>William C. Dietz</b>&nbsp;is the national bestselling author of more than forty novels, some of which have been translated into German, Russian, and Japanese. His works include the Legion of the Damned novels and the Mutant Files series. He grew up in the Seattle area, served as a medic with the Navy and Marine Corps, graduated from the University of Washington, and has been employed as a surgical technician, college instructor, and television news writer, director, and producer. Prior to becoming a full-time writer, Dietz served as director of public relations and marketing for an international telephone company. He and his wife live near Gig Harbor, Washington.This imperial space opera takes up the theme of fighting against impossible odds. At the center of the story is a futuristic French Foreign Legion made up of cyborgs and other societal misfits. The scrappy, chip-on-their-shoulder soldiers occupy their own planet in the far reaches of a contracting human space empire. When a xenophobic alien empire strikes at the humans, the legion becomes the last best hope for human salvation. The legionnaires are an oddball lot, ranging from their cut-throat, sexy commander, General Marianne Mosby, to the passionate Sergeant Bill Booly and the industrious, never-say-can't Legion General Ian St. James. Their cyberborgic compadres, with human minds trapped in armored killing machines, are rich and quirky characters as well. Throw in a Nero-like emperor more interested in his own pleasure than in the future of his empire, aristocratic conspirators working behind the scenes to take over the throne and ruthless, paranoid aliens with no way of understanding human psychology, and Dietz's ( Drifter's War ) latest tale becomes exciting and suspenseful. The humanity of the characters mixes well with the action to give this space drama real punch. <br>Copyright 1993 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Journals of Grace Hartigan, 1951-1955</h2><p>Grace Hartigan emerged during the 1950s as a leading representative of the "second generation" of the New York School of abstract expressionist painters, a movement that achieved international standing for American art. In 1958, Hartigan was the only woman and one of only two artists under forty chosen by the Museum of Modern Art for a show on that school. Entitled The New American Painting, the show traveled to eight European countries and included such artists as Willem de Kooning, Robert Motherwell, Barnett Newman, Jackson Pollock, and Mark Rothko. <br><br>Published for the first time, Hartigan&#x2019;s journals offer readers an intimate chronicle of the vibrant artistic and literary milieu of the times. Hartigan&#x2019;s interactions with many of its leading artists, and her close association with such New York School poets as John Ashbery, Kenneth Koch, and Frank O&#x2019;Hara, make for fascinating reading. The only contemporaneous record of this extraordinary period in art history, this book is a treasure to the art student and literary scholar alike. <br><br>Grace Hartigan&#x2019;s paintings are held in museums throughout the United States, including the Metropolitan Museum and the Whitney Museum of Art.

A whole afternoon. One entire afternoon off and she was doing what with it? Meeting some ridiculously hot guy at a restaurant who would take one look at her, turn, and run. Drew. His name was Drew and the picture the matchmaking company had sent showed a blond man in his thirties who should probably be on the cover of a magazine. Had it been an online service, she might have felt more comfortable. People on those always used the absolutely most flattering picture they could. Sometimes they were years old and pounds of weight ago. Sometimes they were flat-out lies.<br><br>But the service she was using actually took the picture themselves. No lies. No hedging the truth. He was that hot.<br><br>She hesitated on the street outside the restaurant. It was a tiny Italian place in the middle of the old city. She loved this part of St. Augustine, with its cobblestone streets and tourists walking around. The sea was never far from here and she could feel a breeze from the Atlantic.<br><br>What was she doing? Why was she even trying?<br><br>Her cell rang, the sound emanating from her massive bag. It had to be massive because she was forced to carry around anything Patricia might need. That was her. She was a walking, talking convenience for the Antichrist.<br><br>Who was probably calling to revoke her afternoon off. Patricia rarely giveth, but she was awfully good at taking away.<br><br>This was one time it might come in handy. She grabbed her phone and frowned as the real reason she was standing in front of a restaurant wearing her finest Spanx and more makeup than normal was smiling from the screen. She flicked her hand across, accepting the call. "Hey, Meri. I thought you were finishing up class."<br><br>"I got out early and I wanted to make sure you're where you're supposed to be."<br><br>Sometimes her sister's instincts were scary good. "I'm at the restaurant, but only to tell him I changed my mind. This was a mistake."<br><br>Meri groaned. "No, it's not. Come on, Carly. I read the file on this guy. He's hot."<br><br>"How did you read the file?" Not that she should be surprised. Along with good instincts, Meri also had the tenacity of a pit bull with a particularly juicy bone.<br><br>"I took a peek last week when I was at your place."<br><br>"That's called invading my privacy." She tried her best big-sister voice.<br><br>It didn't faze Meri at all. "Yes, it's my favorite hobby! And that Drew guy is superhot. They should have the dudes take their shirts off."<br><br>"Hello, sexist much? What are they teaching you at that school?"<br><br>"That men have objectified women for thousands of years and we need to catch up. When he gets there ask him if he has those notches on his hips. That is so hot."<br><br>"I'm not asking him to strip down. I'm asking him to leave," she admitted. "I'm not ready for this. Even if I was ready for this, it wouldn't be with him. I want a nice, normal guy. One who isn't a felon. That's a hard line for me."<br><br>"Not every man in the world is Roger," Meri pointed out.<br><br>No, they weren't, but that one mistake wouldn't seem to go away. She thought about the message she'd gotten a few days before. Her husband owed money and they were coming after her for it. She'd tried telling them they were divorced and she wasn't responsible for some debt he'd taken on in prison, but apparently the mob wasn't big on divorce.<br><br>She put it out of her head. She would go to the cops. It would all go away. First she needed to deal with the problem of hot Drew and her sister's need to get her laid.<br><br>"I know that. But it was really bad and I need more me time."<br><br>Meri sighed over the line. "It's been two years. It's going to dry up. I learned that in my anatomy class. If you don't use it, a vagina turns to dust."<br><br>Her sister was so nasty sometimes, but Carly had to laugh. "Well, I will sweep that sucker up, then, because it's gotten me into a lot of trouble in the past." She sighed, missing her sister since she transferred to Duke. "I'll meet him and talk to him, but don't expect more than that."<br><br>"It's all I ask," Meri replied, sounding chipper. "Well, and that you give me all the dirty details. Tell me something. Have you thought about dumping Patricia the Terrible and moving up here with me? I found a job at the school you would love."<br><br>Yeah, she likely would. And then her sister might see the inside of a prison cell. Two more years. She had two more years until the statute of limitations ran out and her sister was free and clear. "You know I love my job."<br><br>There was a pause on the line. "I know you say that. I don't know how much I believe it. All right. I love you. Call me later and tell me everything and stop frowning."<br><br>The line clicked and she put her phone back in her bag. She wasn't frowning. Well, maybe a bit. The waitress showed her to a table on the patio overlooking the street.<br><br>She would smile, shake his hand, and they would both laugh about the mistake. They were horrifically mismatched.<br><br>She glanced down at the menu. Of course, he might not show at all. She might get to sit here in the sun and have a lovely meal that didn't include salad and she would pull out her tablet and read. That would be awesome. Lasagna and a book. Maybe a glass of pinot and some cheesecake. All alone.<br><br>She was sure that sounded pitiful to some people, but it was the perfect afternoon for her. Peace, quiet, solitude. No overbearing bosses or their lecherous husbands. If that man accidentaly touched her ass one more time, she wasn't going to care that he was eighty-seven. He would get a colonoscopy the hard way. She would shove that cane of his right up his keister.<br><br>She glanced out and saw a man walking up the street. Whoa. Now, there was a man she could look at for days. With dark hair that curled around his ears, he looked like a movie star. She noticed two other women stopping to stare at him as he passed.<br><br>Was there a movie filming in town? No. Patricia always knew about those. She would try to get the stars to give her magazine an interview or get them on her show to talk about home decorating tips.<br><br>Of course, Patricia had been distracted lately. Ever since she'd come back from the funeral of an old business partner, she'd been distant, not quite her old evil self. Oh, she humiliated Carly at least twice a day, but she lacked the vigor and glee she used to have.<br><br>Carly had to wonder if Steven Castalano had been the one true love Patricia had talked about that night when she'd gotten too drunk, the day before her wedding when she'd acted almost human. That was the night she'd seen the devil cry.<br><br>Five more minutes and she would declare herself free and clear. Maybe she would switch restaurants in case this Drew guy was the kind of man who showed up super late to a date. Columbia wasn't far away. She could get some sangria and Cuban food.<br><br>Anything to enjoy her one afternoon to herself. Soon they would go back to LA and the guesthouse she stayed in there. It was close to Patricia's Santa Monica mansion. Close enough that she could be at Patricia's side in less than a minute. She knew that because Patricia had timed her and told her not to go over that minute. The guesthouse was nice, but it had nothing of Carly in it. She would miss her townhouse.<br><br>Two more years. Just two more years.<br><br>She watched as the incredibly hot man walked her way. Not hers, of course, but in the general direction she was sitting in. Not general. Actual. He was walking right toward her, and that was when the grin hit his face.<br><br>When his lips curled up, he went from brooding god to an angel. The dark, fallen kind who could do all manner of dirty things because they weren't stuck up in heaven anymore.<br><br>When the hell had she gotten so creative?<br><br>He pulled out the chair across from Carly. "Hey, my name is Brandon Lawless."<br><br>She looked around. This was some kind of joke. It had to be. Or he was seriously mistaken. He didn't look drunk, but some guys hid it well. "Um, you have the wrong girl."<br><br>His grin moved to a full-out smile and she had to catch her breath. "Nope. I've got the right girl. Carly, your boss murdered my parents twenty years ago. What do you say you help me bring her to justice?"<br><br>"Are you insane?" She looked around again. There was definitely a camera hidden somewhere. She wouldn't put it past some network to talk Patricia into pranking her assistant. She would do it in a heartbeat if she thought it would help her image.<br><br>"Not at all. I'm quite serious."<br><br>So pretty and so crazy. "Look, I'm waiting for a date so I don't have time to talk." Something about what he'd said earlier clicked in her brain. "How did you know my name?"<br><br>He sat back, his eyes piercing into her. "I know everything about you."<br><br>A chill went through her as she realized exactly who this person could be. "Who sent you?"<br><br>He frowned, the expression marring his beauty not one bit. "Sent me? No one. You were supposed to meet with my brother, but he was going to confuse things and turn this whole operation into one big spy game. Our sister married a guy who's kind of a spy. He works for the CIA from time to time. I think Drew's jealous of Case. He's always thought he would make a good James Bond. But our last spy thing went horribly wrong and my new sister-in-law got arrested and almost walked out on Riley and . . . I should start at the beginning. First off, call me Bran. Everyone does. I'm not fond of Brandon."<br><br>He talked superfast. She didn't understand most of what he was saying, but she needed to get her point across. "Tell DiLuca that I don't care what Roger is doing in prison. His debts are no longer mine. Get with the damn twenty-first century. We're divorced. Shiv him or something. I don't care, but stop harassing me."<br><br>"What?"<br><br>She started to push her chair back. "You heard me. Tell your boss I'll go to the cops if he calls me again."<br><br>She stood to go, but he was faster. He got into her space, his hand shooting out to grasp her wrist. The touch sent a wave of heat through her. He didn't tighten his grip or try to force her to sit back down. The hand that wrapped around her was gentle and his eyes softened.<br><br>"Are you in trouble, sweetheart? Because I can help you."<br><br>She almost believed him. "You can let me go."<br><br>His hand dropped immediately but he was still in her space, his big body towering over her. She wasn't tiny but this man made her feel practically petite. "I can't. Please let me explain myself. I'll pay for lunch and everything. I'm not from this DiLuca person. He's not my boss. My brother would tell you he's the boss of me, but I protest. He'll probably try to fire me for fucking this up, but I don't think you can fire your little brother."<br><br>He was so close but somehow she didn't feel overwhelmed or threatened by him. His words were almost sweet. Still, she knew her instincts were a faulty thing. "I should go. I don't know what's going on with your brother, but it's none of my business."<br><br>"Let me make it your business. Carly, I've studied you and I think you're a good woman trapped in a nasty world. My parents were in your position twenty years ago and Patricia Cain murdered them. I don't want that to happen to you. Please let me make my case. If you can look at me and tell me the Patricia Cain you work for isn't capable of murder, then I will apologize for interrupting your afternoon and let you be. If you can't, please help me. I'm not looking for revenge. I'm looking for justice. For my parents."<br><br>There was absolutely nothing in his manner or demeanor that told her he was lying. This gorgeous man was asking her for help and she wanted to turn him away. Years of working under that woman and her marriage to Roger had turned her cold and uncaring of anyone but her sister. It was the only way to protect herself. She would do the smart thing and simply walk away.<br><br>Carly moved back, her hand on her chair as she began to sit down. He immediately moved in, holding the chair for her and easing her back to the table.<br><br>She was still the same idiot she'd been years ago, and suddenly there was something comforting about that knowledge. She wasn't as hard as she'd thought. The minute the chance to help someone else had come up, her dumb ass was sitting back down and trying to do the right thing.<br><br>"Hey, are you all right?" He was standing above her and his hand came down, thumb running over her cheek to catch the tear she hadn't realized she'd shed. "I don't want to hurt you."<br><br>She took a deep breath. "I'm fine. Please tell me your story because we both know that she's capable of anything."<br><br>It was a risk. He could have been sent here by Patricia herself to test Carly's loyalty, though Carly doubted it. Patricia was too self-centered to think Carly could hurt her.<br><br>Yes, it was a risk, but maybe it was a risk that would pay off.<br><br>He sat back down across from her and picked up his menu. "Lunch is on me. It's a long story. I think we'll need some wine."<br><br>She nodded. She could definitely use a drink.<br><br>She was so much more beautiful up close, where he could see her small expressions and the way her eyes lit up when the wine was placed in front of her. He'd watched her carefully, taking in all the tiny tics that made up who she was. Her lips had curled up as she'd taken a sip of the rich pinot noir she'd requested.</p><h2>A History of English Food</h2><p><p><b>A sumptuously presented personal history of English food, from medieval times to the present day,&nbsp;by a beloved food writer of the<i> Two Fat Ladies</i></b></p><p>In a&nbsp;major new history of English food, Clarissa Dickson Wright takes the reader on a journey from the time of the Second Crusade and the feasts of medieval kings to the cuisine&#x2014;both good and bad&#x2014;of the present day. She looks at the shifting influences on the national diet as new ideas and ingredients arrived, and as immigrant communities made their contribution to the life of the country. She evokes lost worlds of open fires and ice houses, of constant pickling and preserving, and of manchet loaves and curly-coated pigs.&nbsp;She also&nbsp;tells the stories of the chefs, cookbook writers, gourmets, and gluttons who have shaped public taste, from the salad-loving Catherine of Aragon to the foodies of today. Above all, she gives a vivid sense of what it was like to sit down to the meals of previous ages, whether an 18th-century labourer's breakfast, a 12-course Victorian banquet, or a lunch out during World War II. Insightful and entertaining by turns, this is a magnificent tour of nearly&nbsp;1,000 years of English cuisine, peppered with surprises and seasoned with Clarissa Dickson Wright's characteristic wit.</p></p><p>CLARISSA DICKSON WRIGHT found fame alongside Jennifer Paterson as one half of the much-loved TV cooking partnership <i>Two Fat Ladies</i>. Her autobiography, <i>Spilling the Beans</i>, was a <i>Sunday Times </i>number one bestseller and she is also the author of many other books, including <i>Clarissa and the Countryman, Clarissa and the Countryman Sally Forth, The Game Cookbook and</i> <i>Potty!</i> She has made several programmes for television about food history, including <i>Clarissa and the King's Cookbook</i> (which looks at recipes from the reign of Richard II), and a documentary on the eighteenth-century food writer Hannah Glasse."Magnificently eccentric and robustly informative . . . an impressive tour of the horizon of a well-stocked mind . . . engaging, funny and admirably entertaining."&nbsp; &#x2014;<i>Sunday Telegraph</i><br><br>"A marvellous read . . .

He hates being trained how to handle a sword or spending time with his mother selling vegetables at the market. He even resents the time he has to spend caring Star, the kingdom&#x2019;s precious Luck Dragon. He wants to be left alone to follow his own interests. He even strikes up a relationship with a marketplace magician, whom his mother tells him he cannot trust and must stay away from.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Then Corin&#x2019;s cousin Elinor comes to live with them, following the death of her parents. This turns his world upside down. Elinor does not trust Corin. He had played practical jokes on her when they were younger, and she is not even ready to believe that he has the ability to speak with the dragon. Not many days after arriving, Elinor is kidnapped and Star takes Corin to the rescue, forcing him to access sides of himself that he is reluctant to acknowledge. This draws the cousins closer, but they still continue to bicker.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Before the Queen has a chance to present Elinor at court, she overhears two men plotting against the crown who then threaten her if she ever speaks of what she has heard. Corin dismisses her suspicions, since one of the men was captain of army, whose loyalty is unquestioned. To keep Elinor safely out of the way, Star suggests that she join Corin for their daily training exercises by the river. To Corin&#x2019;s surprise, Elinor takes to the training and already has skills that surpass his. This motivates him to try harder, and the two add competition at arms to their growing rivalry. It is not long before Elinor is able to convince Corin that her suspicions are founded.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; All this time, both Corin and Elinor have continued their relationship with the marketplace magician. Corin&#x2019;s parents warn him to stay away, suspecting that he may be behind the mysterious malaise that has overcome Star. Harsh words pass between father and son, both expressing sentiments they later regret speaking.&nbsp; The cousins are split, not wanting to be disobedient, and at the same time, trusting that the magician can help them.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; One day after market, the cousins are ambushed and Elinor is again carried away and stowed in the hold of a riverboat. Corin tracks the kidnappers down and in the deep of night rescues his cousin.&nbsp; In their flight, they are rescued from pursuit in an unexpected encounter with the marketplace magician. The magician, Thos, introduces them to his community of free spirits, the Enclave. He warns the cousins to keep their true identity secret, since the royal family is not popular among the residents. Their return to Gladur Nock is delayed because Elinor had injured her ankle during their escape.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; While staying in the Enclave, Corin&#x2019;s eyes are opened to the mistrust and animosity his family and even Star are viewed by those who consider themselves disenfranchised. Thos shows him his workshops where the people process a flammable oil called naphtha. Corin begins to understand the needs of these people and sympathizes with their goals. Thos is called away, and tells the cousins to remain until he summons them. When the message arrives, Corin realizes he must take action to derail the plot against his family and reconcile the differences with the alienated population. Before leaving, he reveals his true identity and strikes a shaky bargain with the leaders of the Enclave.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; In the meantime, the king has vanished, searching for the lost cousins. The queen, in desperation, accepts an offering of peace from to the king to the north with whom they have long been at war. Together with her personal guard, she travels to a peace summit. However, once arrived, she is taken captive and told they will burn her as a witch. Unbeknownst to her, the king sits in the dungeon, captured while searching for their son.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Elinor and Corin arrive at this very stronghold, and the king rejoices that he can now destroy them all. Knowing that the dragon will fly to their rescue, he has devised a tar pit in which Star is entrapped and slowly engulfed. Corin, Elinor and the king, however, escape and arm themselves. They fight to reach the queen who is bound to a stake to be burned. They fight against impossible odds, when suddenly an army from the Enclave arrives and utilizes the naphtha they produce to fight against the larger force. Yet even with their flame-throwers, they are no match against the king&#x2019;s army. At the last moment, Michael&#x2019;s captain arrives leading a force that takes the field.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Corin saves Star from a tarry end, and after proving himself on the field of battle, using his skills at sewing to attend to the wounded. He had been under the physician&#x2019;s guidance all along.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thos is revealed to be Aga, who had appeared to keep an eye on the young prince and the dragon. He convinces the king to let Corin travel with him and learn about the wider world. Elinor discovers an uncanny connection to Star and happily remains behind to be his caretaker.</p><p>Donald Samson grew up in the mega-urban environment of Los Angeles at a time when the smog was thick and the freeways were flinging their tentacles throughout the city. &nbsp;&nbsp;After expanding his horizons through study at UC Santa Barbara, he sought fresh air and adventure.&nbsp; He set off for a dozen years of travel, living as an expat first in Greece, then for a long stretch in Germany, and finally landing in the Bernese Alps of Switzerland. Upon returning to the States, he learned the art of teaching children, and was a Waldorf class teacher for nineteen years. It was during this time that he developed his love for storytelling. His first books owe their origin to stories he told to one of his classes. It was his students' persistent requests (badgering, really) to read the stories he had told that led him to write them down.&nbsp; He currently lives in western Colorado working as the educational director of a public charter Waldorf school.</p><h2>Modoc: The Tribe That Wouldn&#39;t Die</h2><p><b>MODOC: The Tribe That Wouldn t Die</b> <br> <br> Cheewa James, a direct Modoc descendant, offers in MODOC: The Tribe That Wouldn t Die an explosive and personal story of her ancestry. A decade of steady research and writing has produced a richly documented, deeply moving narrative. The book also contains 30 fictionalized vignettes. <br> <br> This book is the most comprehensive ever written about this remarkable tribe, covering Modoc ancestral times, the Modoc War, and the practically unknown story of what happened after the war. Its 350 pages contain over 150 blk/wh and color photographs, many rare and never before published. <br> <br> In a desperate, last-ditch effort in 1873 to cling to their ancestral lands, the Modoc Indians, numbering some 55 warriors, fought the U. S. Army s most expensive American Indian war. It cost $10,000 in 1873 currency to subdue each Modoc warrior. That is $282,220 in today s money. By the end of the six-month battle, over 1,000 soldiers were involved. <br> <br> James book documents the massive attempt to rout out the Modocs and their families. The match for the Modoc Stronghold has not been built and never will be...It is the most impregnable fortress in the world, despaired Lt. Thomas Wright, who fought and eventually died in the war. The natural fortification still exists today in the jagged, desolate terrain known as the Lava Beds National Monument, California. <br> <br> Were it not for Custer s Little Bighorn Battle, the Modoc War would probably be remembered as America s most significant Indian confrontation. Lt. Col. Frank Wheaton, who commanded the military, said in an 1873 comment: I have never before encountered an enemy, civilized or savage, occupying a position of such great natural strength as the Modoc Stronghold. Nor have I ever seen a better armed or more skillful foe. <br> <br> This war dominated the front pages of newspapers all over America. A brigadier general was killed. Military men dropped like flies and most soldiers never even saw an Indian, as elusive Modocs slipped through the tortuous lava, in and out of the Stronghold. <br> <br> James book is unique because it reveals for the first time the contents of two sets of letters written 135 years ago by military soldiers who fought in the war. The substance of these letters adds new pages to Modoc history. <br> <br> It is generally acknowledged that the Modoc culture, including the language, was lost as a result of the war. What is not realized is that the last chapter of that war is not yet written. One hundred and fifty Modoc men, women, and children were put in chains at the end of the war and sent by train as prisoners of war to Oklahoma Indian Territory. Approximately one hundred other Modocs, who did not participate in the war, remained on a reservation in Oregon. Families were split, separated by half a continent. Relatives were torn apart as their wails filled the air. Tribal culture and structure fell into decline. <br> <br> One hundred thirty-five years later, the descendants of these Modoc people, having the same bloodlines and ancestors, possessing the same family pictures tucked away in drawers and old photo albums, are strangers. They do not know each other. <br> <br> It is time to unify the Modocs in spirit erase the forced split resulting from those terrible days. What balm that would bring to the souls of those old Modocs. It is time for cousins to meet cousins and kin to know what happened over a century ago. Modocs need to know how they belong to each other even now. We need to build an understanding of other people and raise our children that way. Honor people as the human beings they are, regardless of race, gender, religion, and all the other walls and barriers to diversity that can be concocted.</p><p><b>Cheewa James</b><br><br> The magic of words has been a motivating force in the life of Cheewa James. A professional speaker, on-air television talent, and author, James moves easily between the spoken and written word.<br><br> Born on the Klamath Indian Reservation, Oregon, James was raised in Taos, New Mexico. Enrolled with the Modoc Tribe of Oklahoma, Cheewa's father was one of America's first American Indian professional basketball players.<br><br> As a professional speaker, Cheewa has worked with corporations and organizations throughout the United States both as a keynote speaker and corporate trainer. She specializes in leadership, balance in life, and dealing with change, emphasizing to audiences that If It Is To Be, It Begins With Me. Her keynote presentation uses principles from Native American thinking that are applied to the contemporary work force. She is known as a master storyteller.<br><br> As a published author, she has written for publications such as Smithsonian Magazine, National Wildlife, Kansas City Star, Portland Oregonian and publications in cities across the United States. Her book Catch the Whisper of the Wind, released by the Chicken Soup for the Soul publishers, tells the inspirational stories of 60 Native people in the United States and Canada.<br><br> Her book, twelve years in the research and writing, Modoc: The Tribe That Wouldn t Die, was released in July of 2008 by Naturegraph Publishers and tells the story of her own tribe. The 350-page book is the most comprehensive ever written on this incredible tribe.<br><br> A former television anchorwoman and reporter in Oregon, Cheewa has received numerous regional and national awards in broadcasting including United Press International Awards and the prestigious National Golden Mike Award for Television Production.

The shadow of laughter behind her eyes when something amuses her but she won&#x2019;t share. When Mara closes her eyes to search for just the right word, she closes hers as well. The shape of Mara&#x2019;s mouth when she&#x2019;s hiding a secret behind her lips is the shape her grandmother&#x2019;s takes, too.<br> <br>The first thing I asked her wasn&#x2019;t how she was alive or why, but&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;What shall I call you?&#x201d;<br> <br>She sits beside me, looking straight ahead, but I see her smile in profile. &#x201c;I told you my name.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t call you&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mara?&#x201d; She finishes for me. &#x201c;Why not?&#x201d;<br> <br>Because her name sticks in my throat. Because the sound of it might kill me.<br> <br>&#x201c;It was my name first,&#x201d; she says.<br> <br>Her voice snaps me back to attention, to this moment, facing this not-Mara beside me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Fine,&#x201d; I say. &#x201c;Your family name, then.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Which one?&#x201d;<br> <br>Her eyes are quick, laughing.<br> <br>&#x201c;If you don&#x2019;t give me a name, I&#x2019;ll choose one for you myself,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>She arches an eyebrow. &#x201c;Go on, then.&#x201d;<br> <br>My thoughts are furred, though, and even as I try and think the name Mara, I&#x2019;m hardly able to get past the first letter.<br> <br>&#x201c;M,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>One of her hands reaches for the collar of her white silk dress. She rubs the fabric with her thumb and studies me. &#x201c;Good choice,&#x201d; she says eventually.<br> <br>Her stare is bold, unflinching, and as the silence stretches between us, I feel more exposed, more raw. &#x201c;Why are you here?&#x201d;<br> <br>She blinks, once. &#x201c;I told you. I need your help.&#x201d;<br> <br>A matter of life and death, she said. Someone we both love.<br> <br>&#x201c;Right. That got me in the car,&#x201d; I concede. &#x201c;But I&#x2019;ll need more if you want me to stay.&#x201d;<br> <br>She watches me, unnaturally still and calm. &#x201c;You have questions.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You have no idea.&#x201d;<br> <br>That cryptic, smug smile again. &#x201c;I have some idea.&#x201d;<br> <br>It helps, her smiling like that. It&#x2019;s harder to be awed by someone so irritating. &#x201c;Your family thinks you&#x2019;re dead,&#x201d; I say.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Mara saw it.&#x201d; Not strictly true, but it catches M&#x2019;s attention.<br> <br>&#x201c;What did she say?&#x201d;<br> <br>I reach back through the door in my mind, the one I closed on Mara minutes or hours ago, God knows which, wincing in anticipation of the memory of her voice, and hear&#x2014;<br> <br>Nothing. Silence.<br> <br>M waits.<br> <br>This is what I remember instead: my father&#x2019;s ghastly Florida mansion. An unused sitting room with furniture draped in drop cloths. Mara&#x2019;s tentative, shaking hands lifting a soft, crude little doll between two pinched fingers, then tossing it forcefully into a fire. The smell of burning hair. The curl of singed paper.<br> <br>That was what we thought was left of Mara&#x2019;s grandmother&#x2014;that doll, the pendant sewn inside of it, and the ashes of her suicide note. The note Mara saw&#x2014;remembered&#x2014;M writing.<br> <br>I look at her grandmother now and consider, not for the first time, that I might be well and truly mad. Maybe something broke in me the moment Mara left. Maybe it broke before.<br> <br>It&#x2019;s a strange and unfamiliar sensation, not knowing whether to trust your own mind. Not knowing if your own senses are betraying you. I never quite got what it was like for Mara, when we met. Never quite understood why she&#x2019;d wanted me to keep that journal, writing about her, for her, when she thought she was losing her mind. Losing herself.<br> <br>I&#x2019;m beginning to get it now.<br> <br>M watches me expectantly, head tilted, a fall of black hair curling on her left shoulder.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mara said you killed yourself when she was three days old,&#x201d; I manage to say.<br> <br>&#x201c;That is what her mother believes, and so that is what she was told.&#x201d;<br> <br>Told? &#x201c;No. Mara saw you. She remembered&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Everything. Mara remembered everything, and she recounted it in extraordinary detail. The scents of the village her grandmother had lived in as a girl. The hushed voice of an older girl sitting beside her, sewing her a friend. My own memory of that day plays like a silent film in my mind; Mara desperate for answers, Mara desperate for my help. Mara&#x2019;s face open and earnest and trusting&#x2014;<br> <br>The memory stings, and I shy away from it. &#x201c;Did you come back?&#x201d; I ask stupidly, filling the silence to drown out my thoughts.<br> <br>&#x201c;From&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Did you die?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not yet.&#x201d;<br> <br>A start. &#x201c;How old are you, then?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How old do I look?&#x201d; she asks, amused.<br> <br>Mara and I did the maths once, back when I&#x2019;d found a photograph of my mother at Cambridge, with M standing beside her. My mother couldn&#x2019;t have been more than twenty-one, twenty-two perhaps. The woman sitting beside me looks exactly the same.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know,&#x201d; I say casually. &#x201c;Thirties, I suppose?&#x201d;<br> <br>She tips her head, acknowledging. &#x201c;Thirty-six.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;How long have you been thirty-six?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;A while.&#x201d; She grins, light and teasing.<br> <br>&#x201c;Cute,&#x201d; I say. The car hits a pothole, reminding me that we&#x2019;re being driven somewhere. Which begs the question&#x2014;<br> <br>&#x201c;Where are we going?&#x201d; I glance out the window, but all I see is city, still, and traffic.<br> <br>M doesn&#x2019;t answer right away. When I turn around, her expression&#x2019;s shifted again, into something blank and unreadable. And then she says, &#x201c;Home.&#x201d;</p><h2>The Devil&#39;s Heart: The Chattan Curse (Chattan Curse, 3)</h2><p><p>New York Times bestselling author Cathy Maxwell continues the her popular historical romance series, the Chattan Curse, with <em>The Devil&#x2019;s Heart.</em></p><p>Lady Margret Chattan, one of the most desirable women in all of England, has no interest&nbsp; whatsoever in marriage.

But he has a new goal: to marry Josie Monahan. He also feels responsibility for Andy Pickard, who he rescued from the Comanche. But tragedy changes Rusty's plans and bent on revenge, he pursues Josie's killer. But the trail he follows may lead him astray.</p><p><i>Texas Vendetta</i><br><i></i>Young Andy Pickard is in the midst of a bloody vendetta. Pickard and Farley Brackett, a former Confederate soldier, must deliver prisoner Jayce Landon to the sheriff of a neighboring county for killing a man named Ned Hopper. The assignment is complicated, for the Landon and Hopper families are in a blood feud: the Landons to free Jayce, the Hoppers to kill him.</p><p><b>This edition of the book is the deluxe, tall rack mass market paperback.</b></p></p><p><p><b>Elmer Kelton</b> (1926-2009) was the award-winning author of more than forty novels, including <i>The Time It Never Rained</i>, <i>Other Men's Horses</i>, <i>Texas Standoff</i> and <i>Hard Trail to Follow</i>. He grew up on a ranch near Crane, Texas, and earned a journalism degree from the University of Texas. His first novel, <i>Hot Iron</i>, was published in 1956. Among his awards have been seven Spurs from Western Writers of America and four Western Heritage awards from the National Cowboy Hall of Fame. His novel <i>The Good Old Boys</i> was made into a television film starring Tommy Lee Jones. In addition to his novels, Kelton worked as an agricultural journalist for 42 years, and served in the infantry in World War II. He died in 2009.</p>1<br>&nbsp;<br>&nbsp;<br>Austin, Texas, January 1874<br>&nbsp;<br>The election had gone smoothly except for certain extra-legal shenanigans perpetrated by both sides. Those were a normal feature of Texas politics and came as no surprise. By contrast the aftermath was chaotic enough to try the patience of saints, if there had been any. Rusty Shannon had encountered few saints in reconstruction Texas.<br>He slow-trotted his dun horse westward along a rutted wagon road skirting the edge of the Colorado River and wished he were back home on the farm where he belonged. On one side of him rode Sheriff Tom Blessing, in his sixties but still blacksmith-strong, solid as a block of oak timber. On the other, Andy Pickard whistled in a country boy's youthful awe and marveled at the town just ahead. His urban experience had been limited to a few small crossroads settlements.<br>Andy declared, "I had no idea Austin was this big. Must be three--maybe four--thousand people here. I never saw such a place in my life."<br>No one knew exactly how long a life that had been. Andy had been orphaned before he was old enough to retain clear memories. Rusty's best judgment was that he might be eighteen or nineteen, allowing some leeway on one side or the other. Strenuous outdoor labor and the excesses of Texas weather had given him a mature appearance beyond his years. He had a young man's seasoned face but had not lost the questing eyes of a boy eager to ride over the hill and see the other side. Girls seemed to consider him handsome. Andy seemed to have no objection to their thinking so.<br>Rusty turned up his frayed old coat collar against a cold wind coming off of the river. He had been wearing that coat for more than ten years, always intending to buy a new one someday when he felt he had a few dollars to spare but always "making do" for one more winter. He said, "San Antonio's bigger. I was there once."<br>His face, browned and chiseled with premature lines, was that of a man forty or more. Actually he was in his mid-thirties, but most had been hard years spent in sun and wind, riding with frontier rangers or walking behind mules and a plow. He said, "Got no use for San Antonio, though. It's overrun with gamblers and whiskey peddlers and pickpockets."<br>Tom Blessing declared, "Austin's worse. It's overrun with lawyers."<br>Andy had seen little of gamblers, whiskey peddlers, pickpockets or lawyers, but he was itching to start. He told Rusty, "You always say I need more learnin'. I'll bet I could learn a lot here."<br>"Mostly stuff you oughtn't to know."<br>Andy was well schooled in the ways of nature, but Rusty had worried about his limited book education. Andy had caught a little here and a little there as country teachers came, stayed a while, then drifted on. Rusty, in his time, had had the advantage of coaching by a foster mother. There had been no woman to help teach Andy. At least he could read a newspaper, and he had an aptitude with figures. He was not easily cheated, nor was he a forgiving victim. Most who tried once never cared to do it a second time.<br>Andy said, "I doubt I'd get bored in a place like this. Bet there's somethin' goin' on all the time."<br>In Rusty's view, that was the trouble. His idea of a perfect day was a quiet one. He had finally begun having a lot of those, thanks to the farm. "Most of it you wouldn't want any part of. Country folks couldn't abide the crowdin'. You soon get tired of people trompin' on your toes all the time."<br>He was here against his will and better judgment. He had planned a journey north toward old Fort Belknap to visit the Monahan family and to bring Josie Monahan back with him as his wife. But Tom had asked him to make this trip, and it was against Rusty's nature to refuse a good friend. Tom had ridden often with Daddy Mike Shannon in old times when there was Indian trouble. He had introduced Rusty to the rangers at a crisis point when Rusty had badly needed somewhere to go. Rusty often said he would follow Tom into hell with a bucket of water. He had, once or twice. Austin might not be hell, but Rusty did not consider it heaven, either.<br>He wished he had not given in to Andy's plea that he be allowed to come along. He dreaded the temptations this town might present to someone no longer a boy but not quite yet a man. Rusty had taken on the responsibility of a foster brother after Andy's nearest; known relative, an uncle, had rejected him. At times, like now, it had been an uneasy burden to carry.<br>He surveyed the town with apprehension. "Tom, reckon how we'll find your friend amongst all those people?"<br>"Maybe we'll get lucky and stumble into him. Otherwise, he's likely puttin' up at a wagon yard. We'll ask around."<br>Tom had been a county sheriff before reconstruction authorities threw him out of office for having served the Texas Confederate government. The recent election had restored his badge after the former Confederates finally regained their right to vote. Another sheriff, a friend of his, had sent word that he was badly needed in Austin. He had not explained his reasons. He had just said to hurry and to bring help. Tom had immediately called on Rusty, respecting his law enforcement experience before war's end had caused the ranger companies to disintegrate.<br>Andy had jumped at a chance to quit the farm a while and see the city. To Rusty he had argued, "You're liable to need somebody to watch your back. You made some enemies while you were a ranger."<br>Rusty suspected Andy's motivation had less to do with protectiveness than with an urge to see something new and enjoy some excitement.<br>Because it was the dead of winter, Rusty and Andy had little farmwork that could not be postponed. Last year's crop was long since harvested, and this year's planting had to await warm ground. It would have been a good time for Rusty to get his red hair trimmed, then take a several-days' ride up to the Monahan place and ask Josie a question he had postponed much too long. Instead, he found himself approaching Austin and wondering why.<br>During ranger service that often took him far from home, Rusty had remained at heart a farmer with a strong tie to land he had known since boyhood. Andy empathized but had never been that dedicated to the soil. A tumultuous boyhood had given him a restless spirit. He welcomed any excuse to saddle Long Red and travel over new ground, to cross rivers he had not previously known.<br>"It's the Indian in him," Rusty had heard people say. "You never saw an Indian stay in one place long unless he was dead."<br>Andy was not Indian, at least by blood, but when he was a small boy the Comanches had taken him. They had held him through several of his vital formative years. Rusty had found him injured and helpless and returned him to the white man's world. But Andy had never given up all of his Indian ways.<br>Rusty hoped youthful curiosity would be satisfied quickly. He doubted that Andy would remain contented for long in a city like Austin any more than he was likely to be content spending all his life on the farm.<br>A squad of black soldiers drew Rusty's attention. He and Andy and Tom had drawn theirs as well. He murmured, "They're studyin' us like we might be outlaws."<br>Tom muttered in a deep voice, "They're lookin' at our guns. They're always afraid some old rebel may take a notion to declare war again." A few had, from time to time.<br>Rusty half expected the soldiers to stop them, but they simply watched in stone-faced silence as the three riders passed by and turned into a long street, which a sign on the comer said was Congress. At the head of it, well to the north, stood an imposing wooden structure larger than any other Rusty could see.<br>Andy's eyes were wide. "Is that the capitol? The place where they make all the laws?"<br>Tom said, "That's the place. Fixin' to be a lot of different faces there now that we've elected a new governor. Be a lot of carpetbaggers huntin' new country."<br>Rusty had mixed feelings about the outsiders who had crowded into Texas after the war, hungry for opportunity. On the positive side they had brought money to a state drained dry after four years of debilitating conflict. On the negative side some had brought a bottomless hunger for anything they could grab and went to any lengths of stealth or violence necessary to satisfy it.<br>Now thousands of ex-Confederates, disenfranchised after the war, had finally recovered their voting rights. By a margin of two to one they had defeated the Union-backed reconstruction governor, Edmund J. Davis. They had voted in Richard Coke, a former Confederate army officer and one of their own. Perhaps that transition accounted for the large numbers of men standing along the street as if waiting for something to happen, Rusty thought. It did not, however, account for so many being heavily burdened by a variety of firearms.<br>Andy grinned. "Looks like the war is fixin' to start again." War had been a central fact of life among the Comanches, often sought after when it did not come on its own.<br>Rusty frowned. "I'm commencin' to wonder what we've ridden into." He reined his dun horse over to a man leaning against a cedar hitching post. "Say, friend, what's the big attraction in town?"<br>The man straightened, fixing suspicious eyes on Rusty, then on Andy and Tom. "I reckon you know, or you wouldn't be here. Did Governor Davis send for you?"<br>"I wouldn't know Edmund J. Davis from George Washington."<br>The man said, "A lot of Davis's friends have come to town includin' his old state police. They're all totin' guns. I see that you are, too."<br>Rusty kept his right hand away from the pistol on his hip, avoiding any appearance of a threat. "We brought our guns because we came a long ways. We didn't know what we might run into, or who."<br>"Just so you ain't one of them Davis police."<br>Mention of the Davis police put a bad taste in Rusty's mouth. "I used to be a ranger, but I never was a state policeman."<br>The governor's special police force--a mixture of white and black--had been organized as part of the state's reconstruction government, replacing the traditional rangers. Excesses had given the force a reputation for arrogance and brutality, arousing enmity in most Texans. Rusty had always felt that a majority were well intentioned, but a scattering of scoundrels overshadowed the law enforcement achievements of the rest.<br>A new legislature had recently abolished the state police to the relief of the citizenry and the consternation of Governor Davis.<br>The man said, "Local folks are naturally stirred up about so many strangers bringin' guns to town. Coke has been sworn in as governor, but Davis won't recognize him. Word has gone around that he has no intention of givin' up the office."<br>"But the people voted him out."<br>"He's declared the election unconstitutional."<br>Tom's face reddened. "He can't. That's not legal."<br>"He claims he's got the authority to say what's legal and what's not. Thinks he's the king of England, or maybe old Pharaoh."<br>The occupying Union forces had given their handpicked governor dictatorial power. He had instituted worthwhile improvements, particularly to the educational system, yet Texans resented his issuing punitive executive orders from which they had no recourse. Though Davis was a Southerner and a longtime citizen of the state, most former Confederates felt that he belonged to the enemy. He had fled Texas early in the war, eventually becoming a brigadier general in the Union army. The governor's office had been his reward.<br>Now it appeared that he did not intend to give it up.<br>Tom said, "We hold no brief for Davis. We voted for Coke." He glanced questioningly at Rusty. "At least I did."<br>Rusty nodded. He, too, had voted for Coke because he felt it was time to shed the smothering reconstruction regime so Texas could work its own way back to order and stability.<br>"Then I'd advise you to either join Coke's militia or take care of your business and move out of town before the roof blows off of the capitol yonder."<br>Pulling away, Rusty muttered to Tom, "I think I see why your sheriff friend asked you to come and bring help."<br>"I've known him a long time. I couldn't turn him down."<br>Tom's loyalty to a friend was such that he had reluctantly left an ailing wife at home to come on this mission. Rusty's loyalty to Tom did not allow him to refuse Tom's request, though he had planned to be marrying Josie Monahan about now. He said, "We're liable to get pulled into a fight that ain't ours. That whole damned war wasn't really ours."<br>Like the late Sam Houston, Rusty had never favored secession from the Union, nor had he ever developed any allegiance to the Confederacy. One reason he had remained with the frontier rangers throughout the war was to avoid conscription into the rebel army. Even so, he had come to resent the oppressive federal occupation.<br>Tom frowned. "I wouldn't have asked you to come if I'd known we were ridin' into a situation like this. Maybe you and Andy better turn around and go home."<br>Disappointed, Andy said, "We ain't hardly seen the city yet."<br>Rusty said, "We've come this far, so we'll wait and size things up. Then we can go home if we're a mind to."<br>Initially Tom had harbored reservations about the wisdom of the war, but once it began he had given his loyalty to Texas and the South without looking back. He said, "Davis got beat fair and square. If he was a proper gentleman he'd recognize the will of the people. He'd yield up the office."<br>Andy said, "The Comanche way is simpler. A chief can't force anybody to do anything. If the people don't like him anymore they just quit payin' attention to him. No election, no fight, no nothin'." He snorted. "And everybody claims white people are smarter."<br>Andy's sorrel shied to one side, bumping against Rusty's dun. Two men burst off the sidewalk and into the dirt street, wildly swinging their fists. Immediately another man joined the fray, then two more, cursing, wrestling awkwardly. Foot and horse traffic stopped. Onlookers crowded around while the fight escalated.<br>Andy asked, "Whose side are we on?"<br>Rusty said, "Nobody's." He saw little difference between the combatants except that some might be drunker than others. He said, "We'd best move on before some fool pulls a gun." He found the way blocked by men rushing to watch the fight.<br>Faces were bloodied and shirts torn, but nobody drew a pistol or knife. Whatever the quarrel was about, the participants did not seem to consider it worth a killing.<br>A city policeman strode down the street, gave the situation a quick study, then stepped back to observe from a comfortable distance, hands in his pockets. Shortly a blue-clad army officer trotted his horse up beside the policeman. His sharp voice indicated he was used to people snapping to attention in his presence. "Aren't you going to stop this?"<br>The policeman did not take his hands from his pockets. "A man can get hurt messin' in where he wasn't asked. Long as they don't kill one another, I say let them have their fun."<br>"You are paid to enforce the peace."<br>"Not near enough. Ain't been any peace around here since this governor business came up. You want to stop the fight, go ahead."<br>"The army is not supposed to interfere. This is a civilian matter."<br>"And this here civilian is goin' into that grog shop yonder to have himself a drink.

Her fine book takes us for a knowing ride inside the rough-and-tumble life of an important and hard-working career musician.&#x201d;&#x2014;Jan Reid, author of <i>The Improbable Rise of Redneck Rock</i> and <i>Sins of the Younger Sons</i> -- Jan Reid Published On: 2017-07-11<br><br>&#x201c;Delbert has long been revered as one of the greatest soul and blues singers alive. He&#x2019;s also a great songwriter, harp player, bandleader, and entrepreneur. In this engaging and revealing biography, you follow his extraordinary journey from Texas roadhouse to international acclaim, including decades of shepherding one of the most successful Blues Cruise companies. Delbert is the nexus of where blues/R&amp;B and country meet, and his life and music span the richest era at the start of rock &#x2019;n&#x2019; roll. He helped create the music we now love and celebrate as Americana and roots.

Delbert McClinton does all of that while delivering a splendiferous uplifting of the soul whenever he opens his mouth in front of a microphone and an audience.

By: Robert Hugh Benson: (World&#39;s classic&#39;s)</h2><p>The brothers of the Torridon family make their way in the world -- the eldest, Ralph, in service to Cromwell and the youngest, Christopher, in service to God and the Catholic church as a monk in the Priory at Lewes. Their paths carry them to completely different destinations and Ralph is instrumental in turning Christopher and his fellow monks out of their monastery. Christopher, however, manages to rise above his pride and anger and ministers to Ralph in his hour of need. ............. Robert Hugh Benson AFSC KC*SG KGCHS (18 November 1871 &#x2013; 19 October 1914) was an English Anglican priest who in 1903 was received into the Roman Catholic Church in which he was ordained priest in 1904. He was a prolific writer of fiction and wrote the notable dystopian novel Lord of the World (1907). His output encompassed historical, horror and science fiction, contemporary fiction, children's stories, plays, apologetics, devotional works and articles. He continued his writing career at the same time as he progressed through the hierarchy to become a Chamberlain to the Pope in 1911 and subsequently titled Monsignor. Early life: Benson was the youngest son of Edward White Benson (Archbishop of Canterbury) and his wife, Mary, and the younger brother of Edward Frederic Benson and A. C. Benson. Benson was educated at Eton College and then studied classics and theology at Trinity College, Cambridge, from 1890 to 1893. In 1895, Benson was ordained a priest in the Church of England by his father, who was the then Archbishop of Canterbury. Career: After his father died suddenly in 1896, Benson was sent on a trip to the Middle East to recover his own health. While there he began to question the status of the Church of England and to consider the claims of the Roman Catholic Church. His own piety began to tend toward the High Church tradition, and he started exploring religious life in various Anglican communities, eventually obtaining permission to join the Community of the Resurrection. Benson made his profession as a member of the community in 1901, at which time he had no thoughts of leaving the Church of England. As he continued his studies and began writing, however, he became more and more uneasy with his own doctrinal position and, on 11 September 1903, he was received into the Catholic Church. He was awarded the Dignitary of Honour of the Order of the Holy Sepulchre. Benson was ordained as a Roman Catholic priest in 1904 and sent to Cambridge. He continued his writing career along with his ministry as a priest. Novelist: Like both his brothers, Edward Frederic Benson ("Fred") and Arthur Christopher Benson, Robert wrote many ghost and horror stories, as well as children's stories and historical fiction. His horror and ghost fiction are collected in The Light Invisible (1903) and A Mirror of Shallott (1907). His novel, Lord of the World (1907), is generally regarded as one of the first modern dystopian novels (see List of dystopian literature).

They unlock opportunities for wealth and travel, but also create incredible chaos--uprooting populations and blighting landscapes. Work on or around the rails leads to unwelcome discoveries and, in light of the Mythos, dire implications in the spread of the rail system as a whole. </p><p>A certain path to uncovering unwelcome truths about the universe is to venture beyond our own "placid island of ignorance" and encounter foreign cultures. The Orient Express serves as the perfect vehicle for such excursions, designed as a bridge between West and East. Movement into mystery forms the central action for many stories in this volume. The only limitation placed upon writers for this collection was that their works somehow involve the Orient Express and the Mythos. </p><p>The last warning whistle has blown, and we are getting underway. Have your tickets at the ready and settle in for a journey across unexpected landscapes to a destination that--well, we'll just let you see for yourself when you arrive.

That is the premise of this pioneering and provocative book, which argues that to adequately understand contemporary media culture we must set out from material realities that precede media themselves&#x2014;Earth&#x2019;s history, geological formations, minerals, and energy. And to do so, writes Jussi Parikka, is to confront the profound environmental and social implications of this ubiquitous, but hardly ephemeral, realm of modern-day life.</p><p>Exploring the resource depletion and material resourcing required for us to use our devices to live networked lives, Parikka grounds his analysis in Siegfried Zielinski&#x2019;s widely discussed notion of deep time&#x2014;but takes it back millennia. Not only are rare earth minerals and many other materials needed to make our digital media machines work, he observes, but used and obsolete media technologies return to the earth as residue of digital culture, contributing to growing layers of toxic waste for future archaeologists to ponder. He shows that these materials must be considered alongside the often dangerous and exploitative labor processes that refine them into the devices underlying our seemingly virtual or immaterial practices.</p><p><i>A Geology of Media</i> demonstrates that the environment does not just surround our media cultural world&#x2014;it runs through it, enables it, and hosts it in an era of unprecedented climate change. While looking backward to Earth&#x2019;s distant past, it also looks forward to a more expansive media theory&#x2014;and, implicitly, media activism&#x2014;to come.<br> &nbsp;</p></p><p><p>Jussi Parikka is professor in technological culture and aesthetics at Winchester School of Art, University of Southampton. He is the author of <i>Insect Media</i> (Minnesota, 2010), <i>Digital Contagions</i>, and <i>What Is Media Archaeology?</i></p><p>"Jussi Parikka&#x2019;s <i>A Geology of Media</i> really expands what media theory can do. The materiality of media is no longer restricted to questions of economies or technics but extends all the way to its molecular composition. It connects the fast calculations of digital time to the deepest of temporalities, that of the earth itself. An essential contribution to a media theory for the Anthropocene."&#x2014;McKenzie Wark, author of <i>Molecular Red</i><br><br> "<i>A Geology of Media</i> does not complete or close down an area of research, but rather opens one up.

It was a victory long overdue for a fragile population of fewer than one hundred whales. Author and certified marine naturalist Sandra Pollard traces the story and destinies of the many Southern Resident orcas captured for commercial purposes in or near the Puget Sound between 1964 and 1976. During this time, these highly intelligent members of the dolphin family lost nearly one-third of their population. Drawing on original archive material, this important volume outlines the history of orca captivity while also recounting the harrowing struggle--and ultimate triumph--for the Puget Sound orcas&#39; freedom.</p><p>Sandra Pollard was brought up in Cornwall, England, and now lives on Whidbey Island, Washington. She is a certified marine naturalist giving land- and boat-based talks about the endangered Southern Resident orcas and other marine mammals of the Salish Sea, a volunteer with the local whale sightings organization, Orca Network, and a member of the Central Puget Sound Marine Mammal Stranding Network. As a freelance writer, she has written pieces for a range of publications."Making liberal use of interviews, correspondence and newspaper accounts, as well as less intensive use of legislative, governmental, and nonprofit records, Pollard constructs an easily digestible narrative for lay individuals curious about the hunting of Puget Sound's Northern and Southern Resident killer whale groups between 1965 and 1976. Puget Sound Whales for Sale significantly succeeds the former (Blackfish) in breadth and depth."<i>Pacific Northwest Quarterly</i></p><h2>High-Performance Sports Conditioning</h2><p><p><br>Today's athletes are breaking records that many thought were untouchable&#x2014;in large part due to the major advances in sports training. <i>High-Performance Sports Conditioning</i> combines these superior modern methods with sample training programs, workouts, and drills to serve as the only conditioning guide you'll need this season. </p><p>This landmark book presents the principles and practices of this new era of athletic training in the most thorough and useful text ever of its kind.

It argues that peace with the Palestinians will leave Israel vulnerable to Iraq and Iran.</p><p>Benjamin Netanyahu's primer on pro-Israel politics is an updated version of an earlier book, <i>A Place Among the Nations</i>. There's a good reason for the revision, of course: in the years since the first book was published, Netanyahu has served as the prime minister of Israel. Yet <i>A Durable Peace</i> is not a stale politician's memoir. It's a resounding plea for Israel's acceptance as a full member of the world community, as well as a call for understanding its unique security needs. <p> Netanyahu displays his knack--perfect for the television era but also helpful on these pages--for channeling complex ideas into pithy statements. Here's Netanyahu on the importance of Israel to the Jewish people: "If there had been a Jewish state in the first half of the [20th] century, there would have been no Holocaust. And if there had not been a Jewish state after the Holocaust, there would have been no Jewish future." On the need for Arab concessions in the peace process: "For the sake of peace, [the Arab states] must renounce their claims to part of the four ten-thousandths--.0004--of the lands they desire, which constitute the very heart of the Jewish homeland and the protective wall of the Jewish state." These are the statements of a skilled debater, and they represent a one-sided view of Middle Eastern politics. Yet Netanyahu also provides an excellent introduction to Zionism and the need to protect a small country against neighbors who have waged war against it. <i>--John J.

Carr's book <i>Germany's Black Holocaust: 1890- 1945</i>, and was immediately intrigued. According to the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, DC, "The fate of black people from 1933 to 1945 in Nazi Germany and in German-occupied territories ranged from isolation to persecution, sterilization, medical experimentation, incarceration, brutality, and murder."&nbsp;<br><br>I realized that while much had been written about the Jewish victims, the fate of Africans and African Americans at the hands of the Nazis was less well documented.&nbsp;<br>I was fascinated by this discovery and set about writing a story that would illuminate this hidden verity. But for many years, the story seemed out of my reach as I struggled to find a connection with the characters.&nbsp;<br><br>Luckily for me, early attempts at creating the story coincided with my ongoing personal genealogy research. For some twenty years I've been consumed with investigating my paternal line; specifically my grandfather, Harold McFadden, who was entirely absent from my father's life, thus a mystery to both of us.&nbsp;<br><br>When I decided to model Harlan Elliott after my grandfather, all that I had been struggling with came to an end.

His Minnesota accent makes it impossible not to compare him to Garrison Keillor, but, really, they don&#39;t have that much in common. Kling&#39;s stories are more personal.

Listeners are more likely to smile and nod in recognition. One of Kling&#39;s stronger qualities is that he doesn&#39;t force stories to any specific length, or even to false resolutions. Some stories are very short, and some are simply bright snippets he wants to share. He stays mostly on the personal topics--family, boyhood mischief, food--but these occasionally bump up against politics and a changing society.

Linen is heavy when it&#x2019;s wet, and it took two of us to make sure the sheets didn&#x2019;t drag on the ground.<br><br> Lena&#x2019;s mother was our washerwoman, and Lena was my best friend. I was twelve years old, and she was thirteen and taller than me and had a bosom.<br><br> We heaved another sheet over the line. &#x201c;What are you going to be when you grow up?&#x201d; I asked. The question just popped out.<br><br> Lena&#x2019;s dark eyes flickered over me. &#x201c;A grown-up lady, I guess.&#x201d; She squared up the corners of the sheet. I passed her a couple of wooden clothespins from a cloth bag, and she clamped the sheet to the line. &#x201c;Like your ma, and mine, looking after a husband and a whole lot of children.&#x201d; I had six brothers and sisters; Lena had eight. Lena shrugged, her skinny shoulders going up and down.<br><br> &#x201c;You planning on being something different?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Yes,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;I am going to be an artist.&#x201d;<br><br> I felt very sure about that, although I&#x2019;d only just arrived at that decision. It was like stepping off a train in a town I&#x2019;d never been to before.<br><br> Lena&#x2019;s face always showed exactly what she was feeling. She shook her head and frowned. &#x201c;An artist?<br><br> What d&#x2019;you mean, Georgie? What kind of artist you planning on being?&#x201d;<br><br> I hadn&#x2019;t thought about that part. Were there different kinds? &#x201c;I want to paint pictures,&#x201d; I said.<br><br> Lena snatched a pillow slip from the basket and flapped it hard. &#x201c;Pictures of what? Cows? Plenty of them around here, for sure.&#x201d;<br><br> Ours was a dairy farm with tobacco as the main cash crop, like most other farms in this part of Wisconsin. She was right&#x2014;there were plenty of cows.<br><br> &#x201c;Pictures of people, but not just anybody. Only people who are good-looking.&#x201d; Gloomy portraits of Mama&#x2019;s ancestors glared down from the walls in our parlor. I didn&#x2019;t want to paint anything like those.<br><br> Lena&#x2019;s face, round and plain as a custard pie, collapsed into a pout. &#x201c;Of me?&#x201d; she asked in a pinched voice, and I understood that she was afraid she wasn&#x2019;t good-looking enough for me to paint her picture.<br><br> &#x201c;Of course, Lena! A very nice one of you!&#x201d;<br><br> Her pout faded, a smile broke across her face, and for that minute she was good-looking. Almost. Her eyes were too close together, and there was no help for that. We threw the last sheet over the clothesline. Lena propped up the sagging rope with a wooden pole. A breeze came up, and the sheets billowed like sails. I stepped back to admire a drift of clouds piling up<br> along the western horizon. The clouds had taken on a violet tint that was deepening to purple. &#x201c;Look at that sky, Lena,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Pretty, isn&#x2019;t it?&#x201d;<br><br> &#x201c;Nuh-uh. Gonna rain, for sure,&#x201d; she grumbled, &#x201c;and we&#x2019;ll just have to take everything down and then hang it all up after it&#x2019;s done.&#x201d;<br><br> Lena was right again. We&#x2019;d just climbed up the narrow, twisty stairs to my tower room when the sky turned the color of wet slate and daggers of lightning slashed through the clouds. We rushed down to rescue the bed linens before the rain broke loose, but we weren&#x2019;t quick enough to avoid getting soaking wet ourselves.<br><br> I was the next-to-oldest O&#x2019;Keeffe, after Francis; then came four sisters with another brother in between. Our mother said that each of us had been given a different talent, and some of us more than others. My sister Ida, two years younger, was the one Mama decided had the most artistic talent. Every time Ida drew a pretty picture, Mama made a fuss about it. I kept it to myself that I did not have in mind just drawing pretty pictures&#x2014;I was going to be an artist. There was a difference, and I knew that, even then.</p><h2>A Course in Miracles and Christianity: A Dialogue</h2><p>&#39;The essential characteristic of A Course in Miracles that lies at the core of our differences is that it is a non-dualistic spirituality. Christianity, as Judaism before it, is a dualistic thought system in which God and the world, spirit and matter, co-exist as separate states, both of which are real. Reality is thus seen to be a dimension of opposites as with good and evil in marked distinction from the Course&#39;s understanding of reality as being only perfect unity in which there are no opposites.&#39; (Adapted from &#34;Summary and Conclusions&#34;) Many students of &#39;A Course in Miracles&#39; have been tempted to call it the &#39;Third Testament,&#39; thereby expressing their belief that it represents the same basic theology of the Bible, although in a more &#34;purified,&#34; i.e., less ego-dominated, or more spiritually evolved form. Kenneth Wapnick and Rev. W. Norris Clarke, S.J., priest, philosopher, theologian, and Professor Emeritus from Fordham University, engage in this dialogue in order to identify the radical differences, as well as the similarities, between the thought systems of A Course in Miracles and biblical Christianity. Fr. Clarke, a Catholic priest, frames his remarks so as to represent the main theological doctrines of most Protestant churches as well. Reflecting the view of &#39;A Course in Miracles&#39; that &#39;a universal theology is impossible, but a universal experience [love] is not only possible but necessary,&#39; The dialogue makes abundantly clear, in the spirit of friends agreeing to disagree, that A Course in Miracles and biblical Christianity reflect entirely different and mutually exclusive theologies that can never be integrated into one coherent spirituality. The dialogue is divided into an Introduction and five chapters: The Origin of the World, Jesus (Nature and Role; The Meaning of the Crucifixion and the Resurrection), The Eucharist, Living in the World, and Summary and Conclusions. The Appendix includes a Glossary, the Nicene Creed, and a summary of the origin and principles of A Course in Miracles.</p><p>Kenneth Wapnick, Ph.D. is a clinical psychologist and one of the foremost teachers of A Course in Miracles, which he has been working with since 1973, when he joined Dr. Helen Schucman, scribe of the Course, and Dr. William Thetford at the Columbia-Presbyterian Medical Center in New York. He has written more than 25 books on the Course, including Love Does Not Condemn, Absence from Felicity: The Story of Helen Schucman and Her Scribing of &#39;A Course in Miracles,&#39; The Message of &#39;A Course in Miracles,&#39; and many others. He has also produced over 150 audio and video titles discussing the principles of the Course. He is President and co-founder, with his wife Gloria, of the Foundation for A Course in Miracles in Temecula, California.From the Introduction by Kenneth Wapnick: <p>For approximately 2,000 years, the Bible has had an incredible hold on Western civilization, and has clearly dominated all other forms of religious thought. Moreover, it has exerted the most powerful influence over the course of Western political, economic, social, moral, and artistic history. The reason for such a hold, when one examines the Bible from the perspective of A Course in Miracles, is the clear expression its theology gives to the ego thought system, justifying for its believers their own needs to be special. (By the same token, biblical believers would draw similar conclusions about the Course's current popularity.) Incidentally, for the purposes of this dialogue, the focus was more on the New Testament, although as the discussion will show, the Old and New Testaments together reflect a common theological orientation. </p><p>Many students of A Course in Miracles have been tempted to call the Course the "Third Testament," expressing their belief that it represents the same basic theology of the Bible, although in a more "purified" (i.e., less ego-dominated) or more spiritually evolved form. As will be clear from the dialogue between Fr. Clarke and me, this grossly distorts what A Course in Miracles teaches, and is a real disservice to both the Course and the Bible. In fact, the Course and the Bible reflect entirely different and mutually exclusive theologies that can never be integrated into one coherent spirituality. </p><p>This crucial difference can be summarized in the statement that for Christians the Bible is the Word of God (Christians differing only to the degree of literalness the various Churches ascribe to it), while from the perspective of A Course in Miracles, the Bible would be seen as just one among many religious documents that reflect the consciousness of the time and culture in which they were written. Based upon the important distinction the Course draws between form and content, the Bible would be understood as merely the form in which a people expressed its view of the world and of God, no different therefore from the works of the great Western poets such as Homer, the Greek tragedians, Dante, Shakespeare, and Goethe, among countless other poets and artists. </p><p>The shared content of all inspired works is the desire to express what is true for their authors, regardless of the form of artistic expression in which it comes. Understood from this point of view, Christianity's mistake has been to elevate the Bible's historical and theological statements into absolute truths, no different from a lover of Shakespeare asserting that his great history plays render an accurate account of English history. </p><p>Therefore, to attempt such a reconciliation between these two spiritual paths -- A Course in Miracles and traditional Christianity -- must inevitably lead to frustration at best, and severe distortion at worst. Indeed, Fr. Clarke has commented, as I mention at the end of the dialogue, that to speak of the Course as a "correction" for Christianity (as I myself had occasionally spoken of it in the past) is misleading. To correct something implies that you are still retaining the basic framework of what you are correcting. A Course in Miracles, on the other hand, directly refutes the very basis of the Christian faith, leaving nothing on which Christians can base their beliefs. </p><p>In summary, therefore, we can conclude that there is no way one can reconcile the God or theology of the Bible with the theology found in A Course in Miracles. Moreover, the figure of Jesus in the Bible is totally incompatible with the Jesus who authored A Course in Miracles. In fact, Jesus himself states in the Course, in obvious reference to the historical images that were drawn from the biblical ones, that bitter idols were made of him "who would be only brother to the world" (C-5.5:7). It is a continual source of amazement -- given the clear distinctions between the biblical and Course figures -- for one to observe how frequently this reconciliation is attempted. In fact, Fr. Clarke makes this observation in the course of the dialogue. </p><p>I have frequently made the public comment that one of the most important lessons a student of A Course in Miracles can learn is how to disagree with someone (whether that person be on another spiritual path, or a student of the Course) without it being an attack. In our world of multiplicity, where personal projections and perceptions rule, it is almost impossible for people to agree when it comes to systems of thought, or on almost anything else for that matter. My father in fact used to say about people holding differences of opinion: "That's what makes horse races." It is also what makes the ego's universe, reflecting the original ego thought that the Son is separate and different in kind from his Creator. Jesus himself comments in A Course in Miracles, as I quote below in the dialogue: "A universal theology is impossible, but a universal experience is not only possible but necessary" (C-in.2:5). The universal experience is love, and the dialogue with Fr. Clarke was held in the loving spirit of respecting differences, agreeing to disagree as it were, thus offering an example of differing without judgment or attack. </p><p>Therefore, it is our hope that this book will contribute to a better understanding of the thought systems of A Course in Miracles and biblical Christianity. It was neither Fr. Clarke's nor my purpose to debate the clear differences which I identified briefly above, and will be discussed more fully in the dialogue. Rather, our purpose was to state them simply, defining the differences (and similarities where they occur) as clearly as possible. Thus, the spirit in which this dialogue has been entered is also meant to reflect theCourse's view of itself: that it is only one among many thousands of spiritual paths (M-1.4:1-2).For in the end, it is the non-judgmental experience of our oneness with God and His creation,rather than the mere acceptance of A Course in Miracles' theology as opposed to that of anotherspiritual system, that constitutes the aim of the Course's curriculum.</p></p><h2>Theater Made Military Knives of World War II (Schiffer Military History Book)</h2><p>The collecting of military theater made knives of World War II is one of the fastest growing fields of collecting in America today.

He is now headmaster of a school in north-east London and lives with his family in Essex.Building on an actual murder in 1284, Doherty (The Death of a King auspiciously begins a mystery series featuring Hugh Corbett, clerk of the King's Bench. Lawrence Duket, goldsmith, kills Ralph Crepyn, moneylender, and flees to London's St. Mary Le Bow for sanctuary. The next day Duket is found hanged inside the locked church, an apparent suicide. Bishop Burnell, Chancellor for King Edward I, assigns Corbett to investigate. Burnell fears that the antiroyal Populares party will join with practitioners of devil worshipat this time, "Christianity is only skin deep." Hugh Corbett is threatened and attacked while probing "a suicide which was really murder which . . . masked treason, sorcery and rebellion." The santanist group seems to be centered at The Mitre, a tavern owned by the beautiful Alice atte Bowe, with whom Corbett falls in love. The mystery is neatly done and Doherty's ease of scholarship in giving us the rich sights, sounds and smells of medieval London is masterful. <br>Copyright 1987 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Skip�Beat!, Vol. 6 (6)</h2><p>Superstar Ren&#39;s manager Yashiro comes down with a nasty cold, but Ren is in the middle of an important shoot and needs someone to look after him.

During the 1970s, Sergio Ram�rez led prominent intellectuals, priests, and business leaders to support the Sandinista National Liberation Front (FSLN), against Anastasio Somoza&#x2019;s dictatorship. After the Sandinistas overthrew the Somoza regime in 1979, Ram�rez served as vice-president under Daniel Ortega from 1985 until 1990, when the FSLN lost power in a national election. Disillusioned by his former comrades&#x2019; increasing intolerance of dissent and resistance to democratization, Ram�rez defected from the Sandinistas in 1995 and founded the Sandinista Renovation Movement. In <i>Adi�s Muchachos</i>, he describes the utopian aspirations for liberation and reform that motivated the Sandinista revolution against the Somoza regime, as well as the triumphs and shortcomings of the movement&#x2019;s leadership as it struggled to turn an insurrection into a government, reconstruct a country beset by poverty and internal conflict, and defend the revolution against the Contras, an armed counterinsurgency supported by the United States. <i>Adi�s Muchachos</i> was first published in 1999. Based on a later edition, this translation includes Ram�rez&#x2019;s thoughts on more recent developments, including the re-election of Daniel Ortega as president in 2006.</p><p>&#x201c;In this poignant memoir, Ram�rez extols the idealism of the youthful Sandinistas, too many of whom fell as martyrs in their bloody battles against the tyrannical Somoza dynasty. At the same time, he recognizes the many errors the inexperienced revolutionaries committed once in power. Ram�rez paints vivid portraits of those Latin American leaders who assisted the Sandinistas.&#x201d; - Richard Feinberg, <i>Foreign Affairs</i><br><br>&#x201c;The English translation of Sergio Ram�rez&#x2019;s 1999 memoir allows the reader a fascinating entr�e into the life and work of one of Central America&#x2019;s most compelling personages and leading writers. This excellent translation of the former revolutionary junta member and vice president of Nicaragua&#x2019;s 1998 book offers a fine introduction, filled with indispensable insights into the romance and tragedy of the revolution.&#x201d; - Jeffrey L. Gould, <i>The Americas</i><br><br>&#x201c;This is an analytically astute if, to say the least, idiosyncratically organized<br>account of the Sandinista Revolution (both and before and after the fall of<br>Anastasio Somoza Debayle). For those who consider the author one of the most thoughtful commentators on his country&#x2019;s political life, the book is a treasure, and well worth close examination by scholars interested in Latin American political history in general and the history of revolutionary change in particular.&#x201d; - Andrew J. Kirkendall,<i> Human Rights Review</i><br><br>&#x201c;Beyond being a valid and interesting source, Ram�rez is also an accomplished writer, whose literary skill shines through in every detail of the memoir. . . . In short, a lot can be learned from this book that transcends history and present day affairs. <i>Adi�s Muchachos</i> provides the reader with inside knowledge of revolutions, global politics, and human aspirations. And perhaps the best gift this book offers is the opportunity to learn while enjoying a great read.&#x201d; - <i>Contemporary Sociology</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Adi�s Muchachos</i> is an extraordinary memoir of the origins, triumphs, and ultimate decline of the Sandinista Revolution. It is written by Sergio Ram�rez, one of Nicaragua&#x2019;s and Central America&#x2019;s leading literary figures and an influential politician and statesman during the crucial decades he discusses, the 1970s through the 1990s. Few memoirs of the Sandinista period treat the movement&#x2019;s ultimate defeat from a critical perspective, and fewer still have been written by one of that period&#x2019;s leading political actors, let alone crafted in such an engrossing fashion, with such an eye for intimate political and cultural detail.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Gilbert M. Joseph</b>, co-editor of <i>A Century of Revolution: Insurgent and Counterinsurgent Violence during Latin America&#x2019;s Long Cold War</i><br><br>&#x201c;Writers who become revolutionaries are a rare breed, and in our age, few compare to Sergio Ram�rez. In this lovely, lyrical, but ultimately heartbreaking, book, he gives an insider&#x2019;s view of how radicalism succeeds and fails. His account is thrilling, poignant, and frightening, decorated with vivid profiles of tyrants, bullies, and idealistic heroes. Ram�rez has long since broken with the increasingly repressive Sandinistas; their loss is literature&#x2019;s gain.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Stephen Kinzer</b>, author of <i>Blood of Brothers: Life and War in Nicaragua</i><br><br>&#x201c;In this poignant memoir, Ram�rez extols the idealism of the youthful Sandinistas, too many of whom fell as martyrs in their bloody battles against the tyrannical Somoza dynasty. At the same time, he recognizes the many errors the inexperienced revolutionaries committed once in power.

Even though people make moral decisions every day, many Christians lack both the ability to evaluate these decisions and a community of discipleship to help inspire a morally faithful life. Compared to the people around them, there is often no discernible difference in how Christians go about making moral choices. As a biblical and practical theologian with three decades of pastoral experience, who has also spent years teaching ethics to undergraduates, Gary Tyra approaches the topic with the practical goal of facilitating moral formation and encouraging an "everyday" moral faithfulness. Tyra argues that Christians can have confidence in their Christ-centered, Spirit-enabled ability to discern and do the will of God in any moral situation. Moral faithfulness follows from a life of Christian discipleship. In an age of moral apathy and theological confusion, <em>Pursuing Moral Faithfulness</em> is a breath of fresh air and a sign of hope for the future.</p><p>Gary Tyra is professor of biblical and practical theology at Vanguard University of Southern California. He is the author most recently of <em>The Holy Spirit in Mission</em> and <em>A Missional Orthodoxy</em>."Gary Tyra addresses the inescapable question 'What is a good person?' with learning and clarity. This is the rare text that will not only inform but also inspire." (John Ortberg, senior pastor of Menlo Park Presbyterian Church, author of Soul Keeping)<br><br>"In a world awash with moral compromise, Gary Tyra provides an outstanding resource for Christian educators, students and ministry leaders alike, calling for God-honoring decision making in everyday life. By highlighting Micah 6:8, as well as spiritual practices that position followers of Jesus to hear the voice of the Holy Spirit, he aligns ethical formation and discipleship, a much-needed reaffirmation. Finally, I have found a book that addresses moral discernment, responsibility and choice that is biblically rich, theologically balanced and overtly practical!" (Diane J. Chandler, Regent University School of Divinity)<br><br>"A fine, practical, hands-on guide to living a life of moral faithfulness in an increasingly faithless, post-Christian culture." (Paul Copan, Pledger Family Chair of Philosophy and Ethics at Palm Beach Atlantic University, coauthor of An Introduction to Biblical Ethics)<br><br>"From his rich experiences as both pastor and professor, Gary Tyra has put his finger on the relatively overall poor condition of Christians' moral discipleship to Jesus, especially due to a pervasive relativism, postmodernism and moralistic therapeutic deism. But he is not just offering here a textbook on moral theories and the identification of what has gone wrong. Nor is he simply trying to develop a decision-making procedure we can methodically apply when facing ethical dilemmas. Much more importantly, he presents a deeply needed corrective to this discipleship deficit. He helps us see the need for balance in our lives between embodying biblical moral principles and virtues, and the need to consider carefully the results of our actions and be responsible for them. Most importantly, he shows us how we can draw upon and listen to the heart of God for guidance in a deeply intimate, personal relationship with him. I highly recommend it." (R. Scott Smith, professor of ethics and Christian apologetics, Biola University)<br><br>"Books promising to unite moral theory and practice are common, but rarely make good on the pledge. This is different. Gary Tyra offers sage moral guidance that informs, but more importantly, identifies practices that transform. <em>Pursuing Moral Faithfulness</em> is a valuable resource for any Christian who seeks ethical integrity and wholeness." (Steve Wilkens, professor of philosophy, Azusa Pacific University, author of Beyond Bumper Sticker Ethics)<br><br>"I'm delighted to see Gary Tyra's book <em>Pursuing Moral Faithfulness: Ethics and Christian Discipleship</em> available to students and people in the church, connecting the life of Jesus and the moral life of the follower of Christ. I'm pleased to see the connection between morality and discipleship being made so clearly in this book. It will serve as a valuable resource to both the academy and the church." (Scott B. Rae, professor of Christian ethics, Talbot School of Theology, Biola University)<br><br>"This is not a book about general ethical theory and practice but about the ethics of discipleship which is ultimately a responsive and responsible relationship with the trinitarian God. Tyra thus shows that Christian ethics and spirituality are two sides of the same coin. Perhaps its most important contribution is to challenge the reader to take seriously the work of the Holy Spirit which makes the pursuit of a distinctively Christian life possible." (Simon Chan, Earnest Lau Professor of Systematic Theology, Trinity Theological College)<br><br>"With keen attention to impulses shaping the moral sensibilities of today's Christians, Gary Tyra carefully guides readers on a serious journey, enabling them to assess their current ethical decision-making practices before helping them better pursue more faithful conduct and character in our ever-changing society. In doing this, he draws from his seasoned experience of teaching a range of students in the globally-diverse cultural context of Southern California. <em>Pursuing Moral Faithfulness</em>, then, provides a rich and timely resource that will serve numerous generations of believers right down to today's millennials, encouraging us all to be more responsible, Spirit-empowered followers of Christ." (Jason S. Sexton, lecturer, honors department, California State University, Fullerton)<br><br>"Gary Tyra tackles a demanding task with courage and conviction, namely, to describe how Christians are to <em>think</em> about how to <em>live</em>. Tyra not only takes readers through the maze of ethical systems, but nobly constructs a Christ-centered, biblically-informed and Spirit-led approach to making moral decisions. It is a great primer on the theory and practice of Christian ethics, but more than that, Tyra proves that if Christians are to make a difference then they have to be different!" (Michael F.

His unconventional approach &#x2014; drawing upon personal experience, addressing readers directly, and writing in Italian rather than Latin &#x2014; marked a turning point in European poetry, when writers departed from highly stylized forms in favor of a simpler style.

His name is invoked for a staggering range of causes; statists and libertarians, nationalists and States' righters, conservatives and radicals all claim his blessing. In this book, Forrest McDonald examines Jefferson's performance as the nation's leader, evaluating his ability as a policy-maker, administrator, and diplomat.<br><br>He delineates, carefully and sympathetically, the Jeffersonian ideology and the agrarian ideal that underlay it; he traces the steps by which the ideology was transformed into a program of action; and he concludes that the interplay between the ideology and the action accounted both for the unparalleled success of Jefferson's first term in office, and for the unmitigated failure of the second term.<br><br>Jefferson as president was a man whose ideological commitments prevented him from reversing calamitous policy stances, a man who could be ruthless in suppressing civil rights when it was politically expedient, a man who was rarely, in the conventional sense of the word, a Jeffersonian. McDonald's portrait reveals him to be at once greater, simpler, and more complexly human than the mere "apostle of liberty" or "spokesman for democracy" that his adulators have relegated him to being.</p><p>The aim of the American Presidency Series is to present historians and the general reading public with interesting, scholarly assessment of the various presidential administrations. These interpretive surveys are intended to cover the broad ground between biographies, specialized monographs, and journalistic accounts.Forrest McDonald is Distinguished Research Professor of History at the University of Alabama and the author of fifteen books including <i>States' Rights and the Union: Imperium in Imperio, 1776-1876; The American Presidency: An Intellectual History; Novus Ordo Seclorum: The Intellectual Origins of the Constitution; "We the People": Economic Origins of the Constitution; E Pluribus Unum: The Foundation of the American Republic, 1776-1790</i>; and <i>The Presidency of George Washington</i>.

Her unique wit and candor radiate through every poem, every line, and her inquisitive mind is everywhere alive and restless. As she writes in one poem, "If Art would only talk it would, at last, reveal / itself for what it is, what we all burn to know."</p></p><p><p><b>Dorothea Tanning</b> (1910-2012) lived an extraordinary life as an artist and writer.

In 2012, she died at the age of 101 at her home in New York City.</p><p>&#x201c;[<i>Coming to That</i>] is playful and unrestrained, each poem containing a spontaneous logic of its own. . . .

His Miami Beach resort hotels - the Fontainebleau, the Eden Roc, and the Bal Harbour Sheraton - are synonymous with the glamour of Miami Beach in the 50s. Lapidus hotels are infamous as the stomping grounds of the Rat Pack and their fellow movie stars. Yet, during his life he was never published in architectural magazines and was discredited by the architectural profession - before undergoing a renaissance as a prophet of postmodernism. This book establishes the importance of his work and offers private insights into a man who once said why be exotic in private? .<br></p><p></p><h2>Eric Rohmer: Interviews (Conversations with Filmmakers Series)</h2><p><p>The 1969 film <i>Ma Nuit chez Maud</i> catapulted its shy academic film director Eric Rohmer (1920-2010) into the limelight, selling over a million tickets in France and earning a nomination for an Academy Award. <i>Ma Nuit chez Maud</i> remains his most famous film, the highlight of an impressive range of films examining the sexual, romantic, and artistic mores of contemporary France, the temptations of desire, the small joys of everyday life, and sometimes, the vicissitudes of history and politics. Yet Rohmer was almost fifty years old when <i>Maud</i> was released and had already had a career as the editor of <i>Cahiers du Cin�ma</i>, a position he lost in a political takeover in 1963. The interviews in this book offer a range of insights into the theoretical, critical, and practical circumstances of Rohmer's remarkably coherent body of films, but also allow Rohmer to act as his own critic, providing us with an array of readings concerning his interest in setting, season, color, and narrative.</p><p>Alongside the application of a theoretical rigor to his own films, Rohmer's interviews also discuss directors as varied as Godard, Carn�, Renoir, and Hitchcock, and the relations of film to painting, architecture, and music. This book reproduces little-known interviews, such as a debate Rohmer undertakes with Women and Film concerning feminism, alongside detailed discussions from <i>Cahiers</i> and <i>Positif</i>, many produced in English here for the first time.</p></p><p><p>Interviews with the director of <i>Ma Nuit chez Maud</i></p><p>Fiona Handyside is lecturer in European film studies at University of Exeter.

Thomas Carter and Elizabeth Collins Cromley provide a comprehensive introduction to the field. Proposing a methodology, Invitation to Vernacular Architecture provides a systematic approach to vernacular architecture fieldwork. The authors walk readers through the process of examining and documenting a building, explaining in detail how to define a research area and create a research plan. They guide students step-by-step in how to take accurate measurements of sites and of building exteriors and interiors and explain what to look for at each level. They show how to find patterns and how to organize information to yield sound interpretations of buildings&#x2019; meanings. As a complement to this practical approach, Carter and Cromley present current scholarship on vernacular architecture and explain the need for a broad theoretical perspective. They show how analysis of facts related to a building can reveal important insights into the behavior and culture of people who lived in a certain area at a certain time. The authors then present a single ordinary house as a case study to explore the different points of view that scholars have brought to the study of vernacular architecture. Rich with illustrations and written in a clear and jargon-free style, Invitation to Vernacular Architecture is an ideal text for courses in architecture, material culture studies, historic preservation, American studies, and history, and a useful guide for anyone interested in the built environment.Thomas Carter is associate professor of architecture at the University of Utah.

Through attentive readings of a variety of artists, including her contemporaries, Ellen Bryant Voigt celebrates the structure and elasticity of lyric poems. She argues for reading as a writer reads&#x2015;with equal parts passion and analysis. Her analyses of the effects of tone, image, voice, and structure connect brilliant theory with tangible examples.</p><p>Intimate as well as informative, the collection begins with a discussion of the creative process and Voigt's fascination with the writing of Flannery O'Connor and Elizabeth Bishop. Readings of lyric poems by Shakespeare, Sidney, Poe, Stevens, Williams, Larkin, Bogan, Roethke, Plath, Levertov, Berryman, and others demonstrate the roles of gender, point of view, image, and music in poetry. An experienced teacher, Voigt focuses on the lyric but encourages, in any study of poetry, original thinking, attention to structure, and, above all, close reading of the work itself. An intelligent and thought-provoking marriage of art and scholarship, <i>The Flexible Lyric</i> exemplifies, with fierceness, dedication, and precision, how the making of poems is not just a trade but a calling.</p></p><p>ELLEN BRYANT VOIGT is a widely honored poet and the author of five books of poems.

What Ellen Bryant Voigt says here needs to be said&#x2015;the reader finds relief as she sorts out the vexed questions of gender, genre, and form&#x2015;using the lyric itself as her source of inquiry.

A must read for anyone interested in learning, or teaching, about the region.&#x201d;&#x2014;Mark Levine, professor of history at UC-Irvine and author of Heavy Metal Islam<br> &nbsp;<br> In the third volume of their graphic history of US and Middle East relations, Jean-Pierre Filiu and David B. take in the tumultuous period that began with Iraq&#x2019;s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 and ended with Obama&#x2019;s decision, in 2013, not to intervene in Syria.<br> &nbsp;<br> Spanning the First Gulf War, the rise of al-Qaeda, the military response to September 11, and the present conflict in Syria, <i>Best of Enemies: Part Three</i> is propelled by a clash between four presidents and their Middle Eastern antagonists: on the one hand, George H. W. Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush, and Barack Obama; on the other, Saddam Hussein, Osama bin Laden, and Bashar al-Assad. Covering 30 years of conflict and diplomacy, <i>Best of Enemies: Part Three</i> is a breezy and engaging guide to the events that shaped the politics of today.</p><p><p>Jean-Pierre Filiu, a historian and Arabist, is a professor at Sciences Po, Paris.

They are seated on a huge pipe in front of a meander of more pipes. The metallic maze signifies what brings them together&#x2014;oil&#x2014;and exemplifies David B.&#x2019;s illustrative strategy in the book. He characteristically evokes the political and economic implications of the narrative by replacing naturalistic detail with striking symbols, such as cannons with legs during the earliest American encounter with the Islamic East, and plenty of pipelines later on. Diplomat turned historian Filiu&#x2019;s text opens with the main action of the ancient Sumerian Epic of Gilgamesh, then rehearses three historic encounters between the U.S. and the dar al-Islam: the Barbary Wars of the Jefferson and Madison administrations; the alliance with Saudi Arabia for oil to fuel WWII; and the 1953 CIA-engineered coup that overthrew Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadegh&#x2019;s government in Iran. Filiu&#x2019;s presentation is very even-handed. Neither the cruel superciliousness of the Barbary pirate states nor the crafty treachery of Kermit Roosevelt in Tehran is whitewashed or sensationalized. --Ray Olson</p><h2>Satan&#39;s Generals: Overcoming Principalities and Powers</h2><p>Are you suffering defeat, feel as if you are cursed and constantly battling illness?

This <i>Selected Poems</i> will be how Coolidge's revolutionary early works will be read for generations to come. The volume includes an Introduction by Bill Berkson, who writes: &#x201c;From the heights each poem appears to take its own peculiar plunge. The insistent musings, discriminations, glees, puzzlements, irritability, those sardonic drive-by puns, and philosophic remarks that register almost as stage whispers without claiming any prior authority, all signify a powerful affection for the world as encompassed, and ultimately, Clark's will to articulate that fabled specific infinity he has had his eye on, the &#x2018;quest to know anything, write everything,&#x2019; the Chapel Perilous of these poems.&#x201d;</p><p><p>Born and raised in Providence, Rhode Island, experimental poet and jazz musician Clark Coolidge has been connected to both the Language movement and the New York School. His poetry utilizes syntactical and sonic patterns to engage, and generate, meaning. In a 1968 poetics statement, he noted, &#x201c;Words have a universe of qualities other than those of descriptive relation: Hardness, Density, Sound-Shape, Vector-Force, &amp; Degrees of Transparency/Opacity.&#x201d; Reviewing Coolidge&#x2019;s collection<i> This Time We Are Both </i>(2010), Olga Zilberbourg observed, &#x201c;[It] is not a work of a cultural tourist, and neither is it a work of an artist whose sole interest is in creating wordscapes. In this long poem, Coolidge is a mature poet who is aware not only of the deep cultural contexts of his words, but also is aware of his poetry being read in political contexts.&#x201d;<br> &nbsp;<br> Coolidge&#x2019;s numerous collections of poetry include <i>This Time We Are Both </i>(2010); <i>Sound as Thought</i> (1990), which was chosen for the New American Poetry Series; <i>Own Face</i> (1978); and <i>Flag Flutter &amp; U.S. Electric</i> (1966).

This extremely funny book, with its rain-sodden peasants of Corca Dorcha who combine pretensions to proficiency in English with true caint na ndaoine in the hope of impressing the insatiable Irish-language enthusiasts, was the proof that the Irish of the Revival had come of age. It earned Flann O&#39;Brien the accolade bestowed upon him by Austin Clarke: `our Gaelic satirist&#39; and is still a useful corrective against the native tendency to take things too seriously. As its subtitle An Milleanach indicates, it satirises Tomas O Criomhthain&#39;s famous Blasket autobiography &#39;An t-Oileanach&#39; as well as other Gaeltacht works like &#39;Caisleain Oir&#39; by Donegal writer Seamus O Grianna (Maire).</p><p>Myles na gCopaleen (aka Flann O&#39;Brien) was born Brian O&#39;Nolan in Strabane in 1911. He began to write as a student at University College Dublin. Thereafter he worked as a civil servant. He wrote a regular tri-weekly column called &#39;The Cruiskeen Lawn&#39; for The Irish Times for twenty-five years from the early 1940s. In this he made his name as a satirist, writing originally in Irish, then more and more in English. His claim to literary fame rests mainly on two post-modernist works in English, At-Swim-Two-Birds (1939) and the posthumous The Third Policeman (1967).</p><h2>Requiem, K626, in Full Score (Dover Miniature Scores: Choral)</h2><p><p>A masterpiece of the choral literature, Mozart's <i>Requiem,</i> his last work, was commissioned in the summer of 1791 but left incomplete at the time of the composer's death in December of the same year. His colleague Franz S�ssmayer finished the work, based on sketches left by Mozart.<br>In the two centuries since its composition, the <i>Requiem</i> has become one of the most recorded and performed works in the repertoire. Reprinted here from the authoritative Breitkopf &amp; H�rtel edition, it combines orchestra, chorus, and four soloists in a deeply moving, elegiac work of glowing intensity.<br>This edition of the <i>Requiem</i> is in full score, with bar-numbered movements for easy reference. Ideal for study in the classroom, at home, or in the concert hall, this affordable, durable, and portable volume will be the edition of choice for music students and music lovers alike.<br></p><p></p></p><p>Contrary to popular fiction (Peter Shaffer's fanciful play <i>Amadeus</i>), there is no particular mystery surrounding the commissioning of Mozart's Requiem. A Viennese musical dilettante who was fond of ordering up music from established composers and then passing (or trying to pass) it off as his own work originally commissioned it. There's more question about how much of it Mozart composed in full or left sketches for, and how much his colleague Franz Sussmayer--asked by Constanze Mozart to complete the work--wrote on his own. Sussmayer, unsurprisingly, claimed a great deal for himself; Constanze averred that her husband had virtually completed the piece before his death and simply left the detail work to be done by another. Many later musicians have been highly critical of Sussmayer's additions, and several other notable composers, including Benjamin Britten, have tried their hands at finishing up and filling in Mozart's musical ideas.<p> Readers can play musical detective and decide for themselves just what Sussmayer contributed to the work--and how well he did it--with the aid of this full orchestral score from Dover, part of its new series of pocket-sized scores that offer convenient size and affordable prices. As is customary with Dover, this is a reprint of an out-of-print original from another publisher (in this case Breitkopf &amp; Hartel), so it does not contain the most up-to-date musical scholarship, nor does it offer much in the way of informative notes on the music. Despite that, it remains a very useful tool for students and music lovers alike. <i>--Sarah Bryan Miller</i></p>A child prodigy who blossomed into the Classical era's most influential composer, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart (1756&#x2013;91) wrote more than 600 works in his brief life. His oeuvre encompasses a wide variety of genres, including symphonic, chamber, operatic, and choral music.</p><h2>Dragon&#39;s Teeth I (World&#39;s End)</h2><p>Format Paperback Subject Fiction Publisher Simon Publications</p><p>Upton Sinclair was born in Baltimore in September 1878. His father moved the family to New York City in 1888. Although his own family was extremely poor, he spent periods of time living with his wealthy grandparents. He later argued that witnessing these extremes turned him into a socialist. Sinclair funded his college education by writing stories for newspapers and magazines. Sinclair s first novel was published in 1901. Sinclair was extremely active in socialist politics throughout his life. His novel &#34;Dragon s Teeth&#34; (1942) on the rise of Nazism won him the Pulitzer Prize. By the time Upton Sinclair died in 1968, he had published more than ninety books.</p><h2>Josephus: Jewish Antiquities, Books VII-VIII (Loeb Classical Library No. 281) (Volume III)</h2><p><p>Josephus, soldier, statesman, historian, was a Jew born at Jerusalem about 37 CE. A man of high descent, he early became learned in Jewish law and Greek literature and was a Pharisee. After pleading in Rome the cause of some Jewish priests he returned to Jerusalem and in 66 tried to prevent revolt against Rome, managing for the Jews the affairs of Galilee. In the troubles which followed he made his peace with Vespasian. Present at the siege of Jerusalem by Titus, he received favours from these two as emperors and from Domitian and assumed their family name Flavius. He died after 97.</p><p>As a historical source Josephus is invaluable. His major works are: <i>History of the Jewish War</i>, in seven books, from 170 BCE to his own time, first written in Aramaic but translated by himself into the Greek we now have; and <i>Jewish Antiquities</i>, in twenty books, from the creation of the world to 66 CE. The Loeb Classical Library edition of the works of Josephus also includes the autobiographical <i>Life</i> and his treatise <i>Against Apion</i>.</p></p><p><p>Ralph Marcus (1900&#x2013;1956) taught at the Jewish Institute of Religion at Columbia and at the University of Chicago.</p></p><h2>Stand Up!: The Story of Minnesota&#x2019;s Protest Tradition</h2><p>When the senatorial election of 2008 between Democrat Al Franken and Republican Norm Coleman stretched on for a contentious six months, people throughout the country wondered about Minnesota's offbeat politics. But Minnesota has been and is now a seedbed for cultural and political movements that have changed the country, and its history weaves a pattern of wide opposition between left and right.<br><br>In this broad and readable narrative, eminent Minnesota historian Rhoda R . Gilman covers the major protest movements of the last 150 years: the abolitionist Republican party, Grangers, antimonopolists, Populists, strikers, progressives, suffragists, Communists, Farmer-Laborites, communes and co-ops, abortion politics, and more. She profiles charismatic and quirky leaders like Ignatius Donnelly, Floyd B. Olson, and Paul Wellstone.

But beneath the headlines there is a fascinating story of a nation of great intellectual variety and depth, and enormous cultural importance. A nation whose impact has been tremendous, not only on its neighbours in the Middle East but on the world as a whole - and through ideas and creativity rather than by the sword. From the time of the prophet Zoroaster, to the powerful ancient Persian Empires, to the revolution of 1979, the hostage crisis and current president Mahmud Ahmadinejad - a controversial figure within as well as outside the country - Michael Axworthy traces a vivid, integrated account of Iran&#39;s past.He explains clearly and carefully both the complex succession of dynasties that ruled ancient Iran and the surprising ethnic diversity of the modern country, held together by a common culture. With Iran again the focus of the world&#39;s attention, and questions about the country&#39;s disposition and intentions pressing, &#34;Iran: Empire of the Mind&#34; is an essential guide to understanding a complicated land.</p><p>Michael Axworthy is the former head of the Iran desk at the Foreign Office and author of a very well-received book on Nader Shah, published in 2006.</p><h2>On Lavender Lane: A Shelter Bay Novel</h2><p>Former Navy SEAL Lucas Chaffee is settling back into civilian life, refurbishing a farmhouse for an old friend who plans to turn it into a culinary school.

Sir Michael had become increasingly alarmed at the effect Gandhi was having on his province, as well as recent demonstrations, strikes, and shows of Hindu-Muslim unity. All these things, to Sir Michael, were a precursor to a second Indian revolt. What happened next shocked the world. An unauthorized gathering in the Jallianwallah Bagh in Amritsar in April 1919 became the focal point for Sir Michael&#x2019;s law enforcers. Dyer marched his soldiers into the walled garden, blocking the only exit. Then, without issuing any order to disperse, he instructed his men to open fire, turning their guns on the thickest parts of the crowd, filled with over a thousand unarmed men, women, and children. For ten minutes, the soldiers continued firing, stopping only when they ran out of ammunition.<br> <br> According to legend, eighteen-year-old Sikh orphan Udham Singh was injured in the attack, and remained surrounded by the dead and dying until he was able to move the next morning. Then, he supposedly picked up a handful of blood-soaked earth, smeared it across his forehead, and vowed to kill the men responsible.<br> <br> The truth, as the author has discovered, is more complex&#x2014;but no less dramatic.

The dusty walled garden was the site of a brutal massacre on April 13, 1919, and for Indians at least, it has come to represent the worst excesses of the Raj. On that day a British officer, Brigadier General Reginald Dyer, hearing that an illegal political meeting was due to take place, ordered his men to open fire on around twenty thousand innocent and unarmed men, women, and children. The youngest victim was a six-month-old baby, the oldest was in his eighties.<br> <br>The lieutenant governor of Punjab, a man named Sir Michael O&#x2019;Dwyer, not only approved of the shootings, but spent much of the rest of his life praising the action and fortitude of his brigadier general. Sir Michael&#x2019;s attitude, coupled with the behavior of British soldiers in the weeks that followed, created a suppurating wound in the Indian psyche. The scar is still livid in the north of India to this day.<br> <br>The number of people killed at Jallianwala Bagh has always been in dispute, with British estimates putting the dead at 379 with 1,100 wounded and Indian sources insisting that around 1,000 people were killed and more than 1,500 wounded. By Dyer&#x2019;s own admission, no order to disperse was given and his soldiers fired 1,650 rounds in Jallianwala Bagh that day. He instructed them to aim into the thickest parts of the crowd, which happened to be by the perimeter, where desperate people were trying to scale walls to escape the bullets. The configuration of the garden and the position of the troops meant civilians were trapped, much like fish in a barrel.<br> <br>The bloodbath, though appalling, could have been so much worse. Dyer later admitted that he would have used machine guns too if he had been able to drive his armored cars through the narrow entrance to the Bagh. He was seeking to teach the restive province a lesson. Punctuated by bullets, his message was clear. The Raj reigned supreme. Dissent would not be tolerated. The empire crushed those who defied it.<br> <br>Ninety-four years later, laying a wreath of white gerberas at the foot of the towering red stone Martyr&#x2019;s Memorial in Amritsar, David Cameron bowed solemnly as India watched. In the visitors&#x2019; condolence book he wrote the following message: &#x201c;This was a deeply shameful event in British history&#x2014;one that Winston Churchill rightly described at the time as &#x2018;monstrous.&#x2019; We must never forget what happened here. And in remembering we must ensure that the United Kingdom stands up for the right of peaceful protest around the world.&#x201d;<br> <br>Though sympathetic, Cameron&#x2019;s words fell short of the apology many Indians had been hoping for. The massacre was indeed monstrous, and I have grown up with its legacy. My grandfather, Lala Ishwar Das Anand, was in the garden that day in 1919. By a quirk of fate, he left Jallianwala Bagh on an errand minutes before the firing started. He remembered Brigadier General Dyer&#x2019;s convoy passing him in the street. When he returned, my grandfather found his friends, young men like him in their late teens, had been killed.<br> <br>According to his children, Ishwar Das Anand suffered survivor&#x2019;s guilt for the rest of his relatively short life. In his late forties, he would lose his sight, but tell his sons never to pity him: &#x201c;God spared my life that day. It is only right that he take the light from my eyes.&#x201d; He never managed to reconcile why he had lived while so many others had not. He found it excruciatingly painful to talk about that day. He died too young. I never got the chance to know him.<br> <br>The story of Jallianwala Bagh is tightly wound round my family&#x2019;s DNA. Ironically, it is also woven into my husband&#x2019;s family history, a fact we only realized years into our marriage. His forebears were peddlers from Punjab who came to settle in Britain in the 1930s. Bizarrely, one of them found himself living with a man named Udham Singh. The happy-go-lucky Punjabi would turn out to be the &#x201c;Patient Assassin&#x201d; of this book, deified in India, the land of my ancestors, but largely unknown in Great Britain, the land of my birth.<br> <br>Speaking to descendants of the peddler community, which came to Britain in the early 1920s, helped me to understand the experience of living in Britain for those early Indian immigrants. For me, they also helped to bring Udham Singh to life.<br> <br>Thanks to my parents I grew up knowing the names of Reginald Dyer and Sir Michael O&#x2019;Dwyer, but of course Udham Singh loomed larger still. According to legend, he, like Ishwar Das Anand, was in the garden on the day of the massacre. Unlike my grandfather he was not crushed by survivor&#x2019;s guilt but rather consumed by violent rage. We, like many Punjabis, were told how Udham, grabbing a clod of blood-soaked earth, squeezed it in his fist, vowing to avenge the dead. No matter how long it took him, no matter how far he would have to go, Udham would kill the men responsible for the carnage.<br> <br>Twenty years later, Udham Singh would fulfill at least part of that bloody promise. He would shoot Sir Michael O&#x2019;Dwyer through the heart at point-blank range in London, just a stone&#x2019;s throw away from the Houses of Parliament.<br> <br>The moment he pulled the trigger, he became the most hated man in Britain, a hero to his countrymen in India, and a pawn in international politics. Joseph Goebbels himself would leap upon Udham&#x2019;s story and use it for Nazi propaganda at the height of the Second World War.<br> <br>In India today, Udham Singh is for many simply a hero, destined to right a terrible wrong. At the other extreme, there are those who traduce him as a Walter Mitty&#x2013;type fantasist, blundering his way into the history books. The truth, as always, lies somewhere between; Udham was neither a saint nor an accidental avenger. His story is far more interesting than that.<br> <br>Like a real-life Tom Ripley, Udham, a low caste, barely literate orphan, spent the majority of his life becoming the &#x201c;Patient Assassin.&#x201d; Obsessed with avenging his countrymen and throwing the British out of his homeland, he inveigled his way into the shadowy worlds of Indian militant nationalism, Russian Bolshevism, and even found himself flirting with the Germans in the run-up to the Second World War. Anybody dedicated to the downfall of the British Empire had something to teach him and he was hungry to learn.<br> <br>Ambitious, tenacious, and brave, Udham was also vain, careless, and callous to those who loved him most. His footsteps have led me on a much longer, more convoluted journey than I ever anticipated. The diversity of sources and need to cross-reference hearsay has been challenging, but not the hardest thing about writing this book. I have also had to consciously distance myself from my own family history. For a while the very names O&#x2019;Dwyer and Dyer paralyzed me. We had been brought up fearing them.<br> <br>Only when I thought of O&#x2019;Dwyer as &#x201c;Michael,&#x201d; the ardent Irish child growing up in Tipperary, or Dyer as &#x201c;Rex,&#x201d; the sensitive boy who cried over a dead monkey he once shot by accident, could I free myself to think about them as men, and even start to understand why they did the things they did. It was the only way I could empathize with the situation they faced in 1919 and the years that followed.<br> <br>The same goes for Udham Singh. He had always been to me one of the pantheon of freedom fighters who had fought against tyranny. I had to block out the statues and stamps dedicated to his memory in India and refused to watch any representations of his legend in popular culture till my own work was complete. I needed to find the man beneath the myth, and marble, and I knew I would not be able to do that if I became dazzled. Thousands of original documents guided my way, and my search for the real Udham Singh led me to people who either had firsthand knowledge of him or were repositories of stories from their parents and grandparents.<br> <br>I found myself left with a surprisingly contemporary story, which resonates with the news I cover today. Udham&#x2019;s is a story of dispossession and radicalization; of &#x201c;Russian interference&#x201d; and a realigning of world powers. It speaks of failures in the seemingly infallible security services. It is also the story of buried facts and &#x201c;fake news.&#x201d; I was left with a picture of one man&#x2019;s very personal obsession wrong-footing some of the world&#x2019;s most powerful players.<br> <br>As to whether Udham really was in the garden the day of the massacre, a source of fierce contention in some quarters, only he knew for sure. What I can say with absolute certainty is that the British authorities were desperate to separate Udham&#x2019;s assassination of Sir Michael O&#x2019;Dwyer from the Jallianwala Bagh massacre. The attendant propaganda surrounding a &#x201c;revenge killing&#x201d; was the last thing they needed with so many Indian troops engaged on the side of the allies in the war.<br> <br>Whether he was there when the bullets started to fly or not, the massacre in Jallianwala Bagh was transformative for Udham Singh. He was both forged and destroyed by the events of April 13, 1919. The massacre became the catalyst turning him from a hopeless, faceless member of India&#x2019;s oppressed masses into a man who would strike one of the most dramatic blows against the empire. Udham Singh dedicated his life to becoming a somebody to his people, to seeing his country free of the British.<br> <br>He would go to the gallows thinking he would lie forever forgotten in an unmarked grave in a foreign land. Though he would never know it, seven years after he was hanged India would be free and his countrymen would declare him one of their greatest sons. They would fight to have his remains returned to them.<br> <br>In 2018 a statue of Udham Singh was unveiled outside Jallianwala Bagh. It shows a man with a clod of presumably blood-heavy earth in his outstretched palm. Udham will forever stand watch over the garden. All who come to pay their respects in the garden will be forced to look up to him, and remember what he did in their name.</p><h2>The Christmas Secret</h2><p><p>They say that behind every great man, there&#x2019;s a great woman, and behind London&#x2019;s most powerful leaders, there stands only one&#x2014;Alex Hyde, business coach par excellence.

Many people in the professions associated with death and dying expressed their immense appreciation, and the book was hailed by death-and-dying pioneer Elizabeth K�bler-Ross as a &#x201c;masterpiece.&#x201d; The second edition of the book was published in 1991, bringing together more of Avatar Adi Da&#x2019;s remarkable Wisdom about death given in the years since the first edition. As Adi Da Samraj essentially retired from active verbal Instruction in April 2000, this third edition of <i>Easy Death </i>stands as a summary communication of His Teaching on matters of life and death. <br><br>The contents of this new edition draw from both previous editions, from new Talks and Writings, and from the remarkable stories of Avatar Adi Da&#x2019;s Spiritual Work with the living and the dying that has continued without cease since the second edition. The volume also contains several excerpts from Avatar Adi Da&#x2019;s principal &#x201c;Source-Text,&#x201d; <i>The Dawn Horse Testament Of The Ruchira Avatar,</i> on the question of death. And perhaps the most significant additions to the third edition are the sections describing Avatar Adi Da&#x2019;s own direct &#x201c;consideration&#x201d; and experience relative of the esoteric process of death and Realization.<br><br>If you are open to the Blessing that flows through the pages of <i>Easy Death,</i> you will find yourself drawn into a heart-conversation as alive and intimate as any secret exchange between Guru and disciple in ancient times. <br><br><i>&#x2013;from the Editor&#x2019;s Preface to the Third Edition</i></p><p>What others have said about this book and about Adi Da: <p>"An engaging anthology -- and a timely one. . . .

An excerpt from "The Truth About Death" in Easy Death <p>You should prepare for death as a process of complete surrender and release of all physical, emotional, and mental clinging to the present body-mind, its relations, and this world. </p><p>Your death should be a complete release of this present "school" and a complete relinquishment of the present design and content of your conditional self. You should fully consent to die at the moment of death, and so be released toward what is new and awaiting you (above and beyond the "realities" of the present body-mind). Your ability to do this will be either enhanced or limited to the same degree that you are able to surrender while alive in the Divine Love-Bliss-Consciousness That Is Real God. </p><p>Therefore, in order for death to be an ecstatic transition for you, you must not only study and prepare for the specific and terminal process of death itself, but (while alive) you must also devote yourself to an ecstatic (or ego-transcending) way of life. </p><p>-- Avatar Adi Da Samraj</p></p><h2>The First Wife: A Tale of Polygamy</h2><p>After twenty years of marriage, Rami discovers that her husband has been living a double--or rather, a quintuple--life. Tony, a senior police officer in Maputo, has apparently been supporting four other families for many years. Rami remains calm in the face of her husband&#39;s duplicity and plots to make an honest man out of him. After Tony is forced to marry the four other women--as well as an additional lover--according to polygamist custom, the rival lovers join together to declare their voices and demand their rights. In this brilliantly funny and feverishly scathing critique, a major work from Mozambique&#39;s first published female novelist, Paulina Chiziane explores her country&#39;s traditional culture, its values and hypocrisy, and the subjection of women the world over.</p><p>PAULINA CHIZIANE was born in an area of Mozambique in 1955 in which communication with the white colonizers was forbidden. She devoted herself to writing in her mid-twenties and became the first Mozambican woman ever to publish a novel. She claims, however, that she is not a novelist: "I am a storyteller... I take my inspiration from tales around the campfire, my first art school." Her works explore themes of race, polygamy, colonization, and cultural change in her country, quietly signaling a new era for African feminism. <br><br>ABOUT THE TRANSLATOR: DAVID BROOKSHAW is a London-born professor of Brazilian Studies at the University of Bristol specializing in comparative literature, translation, and postcolonial Portuguese literature. He has translated works by Mia Cuoto and On�simo Almeida and compiled an anthology of stories by the Portuguese author Jos� Rodrigues Migu�is."Rami's realistic, back-and-forth struggle to believe the promises of her lying but charming husband remains suspensefully unresolved right up to the last page and the final surprise.&nbsp;Chiziane's down-to-earth style in&nbsp;<i>The First Wife</i>&nbsp;is that of an African storyteller, sometimes rhythmical and repetitive, frequently composed of short, staccato sentences in an exclamatory rush....&nbsp;Feisty and exuberant, ferociously candid...

As a result, we are losing a sense of the concrete and imposing presence of the real, and the fundamental claim it makes on us, a claim that Iris Murdoch once described as the essence of love. In response to this postmodern predicament, the present book aims to draw on the classical philosophical tradition in order to articulate a robust philosophical anthropology, and a new appreciation of the importance of the &#34;&#34;transcendental properties&#34;&#34; of being: beauty, goodness, and truth. The book begins with a reflection on the importance of metaphysics in our contemporary setting, and then presents the human person&#39;s relation to the world under the signs of the transcendentals: beauty is the gracious invitation into reality, goodness is the self-gift of freedom in response to this invitation, and truth is the consummation of our relation to the real in knowledge. The book culminates in an argument for why love is ultimately a matter of being, and why metaphysical reason in indispensable in faith. &#34;&#34;Philosopher D. C. Schindler defies the dragon of modernity, whose dominant thought patterns induce a life- and culture-threatening loss of reality and self. He offers life-giving proposals regarding love, being, and the transcendentals to restore us profoundly to the world and to ourselves as humans. Buy the book--you may divest yourself of others. Digest it, and revel in your already-involvement with a responsive reality--an involvement of intimate encounter and communion; a reality that is love, fraught with beauty, goodness, and truth.&#34;&#34; --Esther Lightcap Meek, Geneva College &#34;&#34;Love and the Postmodern Predicament is a treasure trove of philosophical riches. Schindler does not merely indicate the need to return to metaphysics to wrestle successfully with what he carefully and accurately describes as our postmodern predicament, but in fact leads us out of that predicament. His profound and original reflections on love, grounded in the transcendental properties of being, are a radical refashioning of traditional metaphysical principles.&#34;&#34; --Jonathan J. Sanford, University of Dallas &#34;&#34;In this rewarding little text, Schindler accomplishes something too rare among works of philosophy: he accommodates a wide audience and yet deftly draws the reader into deep metaphysical waters, into a consideration of some of the most profound and perennial philosophical concerns. Throughout, the timeliness of his reflections on love, beauty, God, and the good remains in clear view. This is a highly recommended work by an author of capacious intellect and generous spirit.&#34;&#34; --Lee M. Cole, Hillsdale College D. C.

In this his masterful novel, Ant�nio Lobo Antunes, "one of the most skillful psychological portraitists writing anywhere, renders the turpitude of an entire society through an impasto of intensely individual voices." (The New Yorker)<br><br>The protagonist and anti-hero Senhor Francisco, a powerful state minister and personal friend of Salazar, expects to be named prime minister when Salazar is incapacitated by a stroke in 1968. Outraged that the President (Admiral Am�rico Tom�s) appoints not him but Marcelo Caetano to the post, Senhor Francisco retreats to his farm in Set�bal, where he vaguely plots a coup with other ex-ministers and aged army officers who feel they've been snubbed or forgotten. But it's younger army officers who in 1974 pull off a coup, the Revolution of the Flowers (so called since no shots were fired, carnations sticking out of the butts of the insurgents' rifles), ending 42 years of dictatorship. Senhor Francisco, more paranoid than ever, accuses all the workers at his farm of being communists and sends them away with a brandished shotgun, remaining all alone - a large but empty shadow of his once seeming omnipotence - to defend a decrepit farm from the figments of his imagination.<br><br>When the novel opens, Senhor Francisco is no longer at the farm but in a nursing home in Lisbon with a bedpan between his legs, having suffered a stroke that left him largely paralyzed. No longer able to speak, he mentally reviews his life and loves. His loves? In fact the only woman he really loved was his wife Isabel, who left him early on, when their son Jo�o was just a tiny boy. Francisco takes up with assorted women and takes sexual advantage of the young maids on the farm, the steward's teenage daughter, and his secretaries at the Ministry, but he can never get over the humiliation of Isabel having jilted him for another man. Many years later he spots a commonplace shop girl, named Mil�, who resembles his ex-wife. He sets the girl and her mother up in a fancy apartment, makes her wear Isabel's old clothes, and introduces her to Salazar and other government officials as his wife, and everyone goes along with the ludicrous sham, because everything about Salazar's Estado Novo ("New State") was sham - from the rickety colonial "empire" in Africa to the emasculate political leaders in the home country, themselves monitored and controlled by the secret police.<br><br>Once the system of shams tumbles like a castle of cards, Francisco's cuckoldry glares at him with even greater scorn than before, and all around him lie casualties. Mil� and her mother return to their grubby notions shop more hopeless than ever, because the mother is dying and Mil� is suddenly a spinster without prospects. The steward, with no more farm to manage, moves his family into a squalid apartment and gets a job at a squalid factory. The minister's son, raised by the housekeeper, grows up to be good-hearted but totally inept, so that his ruthless in-laws easily defraud him of his father's farm, which they turn into a tourist resort. The minister's daughter, Paula, whom he had by the cook and who was raised by a childless widow in another town, is ostracized after the Revolution because of who her father was, even though she hardly ever knew him.<br><br>Isabel, the ex-wife, also ends up all alone, in a crummy kitchenette in Lisbon, but she isn't a casualty of Senhor Francisco or of society or of a political regime but of love, of its near impossibility. Disillusioned by all the relationships she had with men, she stoutly resists Francisco's ardent attempts to win her back, preferring solitude instead.<br><br>We have to go to the housekeeper, Titina, this novel's most compelling character, to find hope of salvation, however unlikely a source she seems. Unattractive and uneducated, Titina never had a romantic love relationship, though she secretly loved her boss, who never suspected. She ends up, like him, in an old folks' home, and like him she spends her days looking back and dreaming of returning to the farm in its heyday. Old age is a great equalizer. And yet the two characters are not equal. Titina retains her innocence. But it's not the innocence of helpless inability - the case of Jo�o, Francisco's son - nor is it the pathetic innocence of Romeu, the emotionally and mentally undeveloped co-worker by whom Paula has a son. Titina isn't helpless or ingenuous, and she isn't immune to the less than flattering human feelings of jealousy, impatience and anger. But she never succumbs to baser instincts. She knows her worth and cultivates it. She is a proud woman, but proud only of what she really is and what she has really accomplished in life.<br><br>At one level (and it operates at many), The Inquisitorssssss' Manual is an inquiry into the difficult coexistence of self-affirmation and tenderness toward others. Their correct balance, which equals human dignity, occurs in the housekeeper.</p><p>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: PortugeseAntonio de Oliveira Salazar is not the best known of 20th-century dictators, but he was as cruel and ruthless as any of them in his rule over Portugal from 1932 to 1968. In his 11th novel, Antunes (The Return of the Caravels; Act of the Damned) recreates the harrowing story of Salazar's regime, building gradually from the petty problems and thoughts of a host of characters, related in stream of consciousness, to blunt exposition of the inhuman inner workings and brutal violence of authoritarianism. An unseen contemporary inquisitor interviews a series of individuals, whose identities are gradually revealed to the reader. These shadowy characters stammer, lie to themselves and compulsively repeat phrases; occasionally, they are sarcastic to the questioner. The central figure is a minor eminence of the fascist government, Senhor Francisco, or "the Minister," whose triumphs and decline are narrated in fragmented and nonsequential fashion. Old, fat and abandoned by the Party as the novel begins, he is spending his last years in a hospital, derided by his nurses: "Time to go wee-wee, Senhor Francisco, time for wee-wee." The minister's son, Joao, is unambitious and simple, and Joao's illegitimate half-sister, Paula, is unattractive, jealous and vindictive, convinced her brother has cheated her out of her inheritance. Supporting characters include Titina, the minister's aging and vain housekeeper; Romeu, a slow-witted dreamer; Cesar, brutally beaten by plainclothesmen; Alice, who shares harsh recollections of Africa. Many of these speakers conjure up a collage of voices as they tell their stories, and the interviews become progressively more narrative, graphically describing the regime of Salazar. With this tapestry of harrowing testimonials, the supremely confident Antunes illuminates a dark corner of European history and produces a stunning piece of narrative art.<br>Copyright 2002 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>The Unfortunate Englishman: A Joe Wilderness Novel (The Joe Wilderness Novels, 2)</h2><p>Berlin, 1963. East End-Londoner turned spy Joe Wilderness has had better days. He is sitting in a West Berlin jail, arrested for shooting someone he thought was about to kill him. His old boss, Lieutenant Burne-Jones of MI6, comes to Berlin to free him, but only under the condition that he rejoin British Intelligence. The knowledge that Wilderness gained of Berlin&#x2019;s underworld while working the black market just after World War II will prove useful to Queen and country now that the city has become the epicenter of the Cold War, dividing the world in two with its wall.<br><br>On the other side of the Iron Curtain, another MI6 man, Geoffrey Masefield, is ruing the day he first agreed to be a spy. In the beginning, it had all seemed so simple, so glamorous: the international travel, the top secret files, the vodka, the women. . . . But now Masefield is stuck in Lubyanka, the KGB&#x2019;s Moscow prison, waiting for a lifeline from his former employer. Meanwhile, over in England, a Russian spy is pining for his homeland. Having lived as Bernard Forbes Campbell Alleyn for years and taken a wife and had two daughters under that alias, he&#x2019;s now been exposed as KGB Captain Leonid Liubimov. Arrested for treason and then for espionage, he is in prison at Wormwood Scrubs, London. The only ticket out for these two men is a spy exchange.<br><br>Posted back to Berlin, Wilderness is to oversee the exchange of Masefield and Liubimov, but his black market nous hasn&#x2019;t diminished. There&#x2019;s money to be made and ten thousand bottles of fine Bordeaux that Wilderness hasn&#x2019;t forgotten about. A brilliantly evocative novel from a writer regularly compared to John le Carr�, <i>The Unfortunate Englishman</i> is a gripping tale of Cold War espionage, and the best laid plans of unfortunate men.</p><p><b>John Lawton</b> worked for Channel 4 for many years.

I was hunched over the Talmudic tractate called Ketubot (Marriage Contracts) in the Jewish Theological Seminary library, trying to decipher rabbinic conversations about girls not yet menstruating who must engage in sexual intercourse to consummate a marriage. How soon after the first time may intercourse be repeated? After four days, says one. Till the wound heals, says another. Not until the following Shabbat, counters yet another rabbinic sage. I once asked Dr. Francus, who graciously let me attend his class in Talmud when no women were as yet admitted to JTS's rabbinic program, whether he thought the sages consulted women on this subject. He stared at me blankly.</p><p>I glanced hopefully out the window. Twilight tinged the horizons, heralding the hour of my release. I swept up the heavy volumes of rabbinic commentary and sailed down the stairs out into the city. A modern sculpture of the burning bush suspended over the entrance to the seminary declared words of revelation: "And the bush was not consumed.' Yellow and red city lights cloaked the iron leaves in a thick urban haze. I swung around, inhaled deeply, and set out toward Union Theological Seminary, where the New York Feminist Scholars in Religion were meeting to discuss their personal relationship with the Goddess. My anxiety level soared. A battery of biblical taboos pounded in my head. "You shall have no other gods before Me! Don't even try to find out about other gods. The practices of other nations are perversions.'</p><p>Yet just as the biblical character Dinah ventured forth, I felt compelled to "go out and meet the women of the land," even though I feared the encounter. I found myself opposite the granite towers of Union Theological Seminary, which stands like a medieval castle on the banks of the Hudson River. I skirted the main entrance and hurried to the north side of the building, where other members of the group clustered around a small wooden door like bees at a hive. Bev Harrison, a Christian feminist and professor of theology at Union, ushered us into a lounge, where we sipped tea and chatted.</p><p>When Bev called us to order, the familiar pounding heart thundered inside me. The all-woman group was composed of the vanguard of Christian and post-Christian feminist scholars and three Jews: Ellen Umansky, Judith Plaskow, and myself. 1, the fledgling feminist, asked myself what I was doing there.</p><p>Carol Christ in particular epitomized my notion of the post-Christian pagan woman. Tall, blond, and beautiful, Carol resembled the nude statue of the Goddess Diana in the Metropolitan Museum. Sinewy and graceful, Diana aims her arrow with precision, her nakedness untamed and free, like the virgin forests she inhabits. Carol similarly evoked a physical and psychic freedom that both excited and panicked me.</p><p>That evening Carol spoke lovingly of the Goddess in her life and the reasons she needed her. She had rejected God for the Goddess.</p><p>I resisted and scurried into an imaginative corner, where the aged Dr. Elk reminded me that the righteous Abraham smashed his father's idols, and Rachel died for hiding female statues under her skirts. Clothed in his faded brown suit, submerged in leather-bound books stacked in formless piles against the walls of his tiny, windowless office in Haifa, Dr. Elk waved a Bible in our faces and told us to open our texts to the first page. I was one of his pupils in 1966, when I spent seven months in Israel as a high school exchange student.</p><p>"Genesis, chapter one, was written in order to demythologize the gods of the ancient Near East. In the Bible, gods and goddess are reduced to natural phenomena under the control of God.' He gave us the example of Tiamat, who appears in the Assyrian creation tale as mother of the gods and the fearsome opponent of the sun god, Marduk. In Genesis she is converted into the primordial abyss called Tehom. Dr. Elk taught us that unlike Asherah, El, Baal, Mot, and Anat, the gods of the Canaanites, YHVH Elohim did not fight or fornicate. He had no opponents, because He was the one true transcendent being. Dr. Elk viewed paganism as a primitive and superstitious religion and Judaism as rational and prophetic. Pagans were slaves to the whims of childish gods, while the Israelites could depend on YHVH's consistency.

This notion of freedom as non-domination offers a yardstick for gauging social and democratic progress and provides a simple, unifying standard for analyzing our most entangled political quandaries.</p><p>Pettit reaffirms the ideal, already present in the Roman Republic, of a free citizenry who enjoy equal status with one another, being individually protected by a law that they together control. After sketching a fresh history of freedom, he turns to the implications of the ideal for social, democratic, and international justice.</p><p>Should the state erect systems for delivering mandatory healthcare coverage to its citizens? Should voting be a citizen&#x2019;s only means of influencing political leaders? Are the demands of the United Nations to be heeded when they betray the sovereignty of the state? Pettit shows how these and other questions should be resolved within a civic republican perspective.</p><p>Concise and elegant in its rhetoric and ultimately radical in its reimagining of our social arrangements, <em>Just Freedom</em> is neither a theoretical treatise nor a practical manifesto, but rather an ardent attempt to elaborate the demands of freedom and justice in our time.</p></p><p>Philip Pettit is the L. S. Rockefeller University Professor of Politics and Human Values at Princeton University and Distinguished Professor of Philosophy at the Australian National University. His many books include Republicanism and On the People&#x2019;s Terms.What principle can guide a politically divided world in resolving its most contentious issues? Pettit finds that principle in the ideal of universal freedom as nondomination. This understanding of freedom, Pettit argues, inheres in the republican tradition that emerged in the mixed constitution of ancient Rome, celebrated by Polybius, Cicero, and Livy, a tradition renewed in the post-Renaissance political philosophy of Northern Europe. Further analysis, however, reveals that modern thinkers such as Bentham, Paley, and Mill decisively broke with that tradition by defining freedom not as nondomination but rather as noninterference. In calling for a twenty-first-century rehabilitation of the republican understanding of freedom, Pettit advocates ambitious government efforts to protect all citizens from intimidation, give them resources to act on their free choices, and engage them in a broadly inclusive democracy. To pursue republican freedom in the global arena, Pettit outlines strategies for international agencies dealing with the prickly sovereignty of each nation and with glaring international disparities in resources.

As a result, he was forced to leave Austria in 1938, narrowly escaping arrest by the Gestapo as he fled to Switzerland and later to the United States. Twenty years later, he was invited to return to Germany as director of the new Institute of Political Science at Ludwig-Maximilian University in Munich.<p></p>In 1964, Voegelin gave a series of memorable lectures on what he considered "the central German experiential problem" of his time: Adolf Hitler's rise to power, the reasons for it, and its consequences for post-Nazi Germany. For Voegelin, these issues demanded a scrutiny of the mentality of individual Germans and of the order of German society during and after the Nazi period. <i>Hitler and the Germans</i> offers Voegelin's most extensive and detailed critique of the Hitler era.<p></p>While most of the lectures deal with what Voegelin called Germany&#x2019;s "descent into the depths" of the moral and spiritual abyss of Nazism and its aftermath, they also point toward a restoration of order. His lecture "The Greatness of Max Weber" shows how Weber, while affected by the culture within which Hitler came to power, had already gone beyond it through his anguished recovery of the experience of transcendence.<p></p><i>Hitler and the Germans</i> provides a profound alternative approach to the topic of the individual German's entanglement in the Hitler regime and its continuing implications. This comprehensive critique of the Nazi period has yet to be matched.<p></p></p><p>Translated, Edited, and with an Introduction by Detlev Clemens and Brendan Purcell<p></p>Eric Voegelin (1901&#x2013;1985) was one of the most original and influential philosophers of our time. Born in Cologne, Germany, he studied at the University of Vienna, where he became a professor of political science in the Faculty of Law. In 1938, he and his wife, fleeing Hitler, immigrated to the United States. They became American citizens in 1944. Voegelin spent much of his career at Louisiana State University, the University of Munich, and the Hoover Institution at Stanford University. During his lifetime he published many books and more than one hundred articles.<br>Detlev Clemens is Assistant Professor at the Institute of Political Science, Friedrich-Alexander University at Erlangen-Nuremberg.

And yet her poetry and life tell a deeper story. Looking closely at twenty-five rare and resonant poems, this intimate portrait reveals how Dickinson occasionally believed, thoughtfully doubted, and in her divine wrestling, met God. In chapters on belief, prayer, mortality, immortality, and beauty, Kristin LeMay uncovers the riches of Dickinson&#x2019;s spiritual life and tells of her own search for God between the lines of the poems Dickinson called &#x201c;hymns.&#x201d; </p>&#x201c;Through her deep engagement with Dickinson&#x2019;s poems&#x2014;by turn prayers, partners, revelations, songs&#x2014;LeMay has written a book that is, in Dickinson&#x2019;s words, &#x2018;the Heart&#x2019;s portrait &#x2013; every Page a Pulse,&#x2019; every page a kind of faith.&#x201d; &nbsp;&#x2013; Sarah Sentilles, author of <i>Breaking Up with God: A Love Story</i><br><br>&#x201c;Part spiritual autobiography, part homage to Dickinson&#x2019;s inexhaustible poetic genius, and part exuberant close readings of the astonishing poems in which she wrestles with questions of faith and belief, <i>I Told My Soul to Sing</i> is a valuable study of the poet&#x2019;s heterodox imagination. LeMay does not shackle Dickinson to a procrustean bed of doctrine and piety, dilute the poet&#x2019;s astringent ironies, or flatten the provocative ambiguities. She has a gift for choosing unfamiliar poems from the canon and for judiciously quoting and interpreting them.

It is a daring endeavor: as Tweetspeak Poetry said, &#x2018;an interesting combination of genres and approaches that could have easily gone awry.&#x2019;&nbsp;But LeMay deftly combines literary analysis with her faith experiences in a way that enriches the well-loved poems of Emily Dickinson, while simultaneously widening the genre of spiritual autobiography. Widen your understanding of the highly personal ways in which art and faith intersect.&#x201d; &#x2014;<b><i>Image</i><i><i>&nbsp;</i>Journal&nbsp;</i></b><br><br>"In 1860, when she was just thirty, Emily Dickinson wrote a poem meditating on Jacob&#x2019;s nightlong wrestling with an unseen stranger in Genesis 32. &#x201c;I will not let thee go / Except thou bless me,&#x201d; she quotes Jacob as saying, then pivots on his realization, moments later as the sun rises, that the stranger who had stooped to struggle with him was God himself: &#x201c;And the bewildered Gymnast / Found he had worsted God!&#x201d; (Poem 145). The poem explodes in wonder that God would permit himself to be known in this way. As Kristin LeMay argues in this striking series of meditations on twenty-five Dickinson poems, this is exactly the realization arrived at by the over eighteen hundred poems and one thousand letters Dickenson wrote, visible if you read them slowly and carefully enough, allowing them to goad and challenge you, rattle you in their inconsistencies, and comfort you in spelling out what you had never seen articulated before. As LeMay puts it, Dickinson was &#x201c;a poet who called herself a pagan, foreswore prayer, never gave a confession of faith, and left the church&#x201d; (p. 164), and yet, for all of her resistance, was finally a poet who could describe herself in a late fragment as &#x201c;grasped by God&#x201d; (p. 234). She seems to have spent a lifetime wondering at a God who would come near, take on her wild blows, and continue to hold on, whispering out of love&#x2019;s weakness, &#x201c;Then have I / Nothing to show / But Calvary&#x2014;&#x201d; (Poem 652).<br><br> I think LeMay is correct in this view of Dickinson, but that is not the real strength of this work, for, as she notes, you can find a version of this position in such scholars as Roger Lundin, James McIntosh, and Alfred Habegger. What is remarkable about the book is the personal struggle it enacts. Much like Dickenson herself, LeMay begins the book with Jacob&#x2019;s opening confidence&#x2014;&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t let her go until she blesses me&#x201d; (p. 11)&#x2014;but ends with Jacob&#x2019;s chastened awareness that the real wonder is that the poet had been the one holding on all along. Twice, in her last year 1886, Dickinson turned Jacob&#x2019;s words and wrote to dear friends, &#x201c;I will not let thee go, except I bless thee&#x201d; (p. 254). LeMay concludes with this thought&#x2014;that the true wonder is that poetry, and through poetry, God himself stoops or condescends to be wrestled with, intending all along to bless in coming near. I read this book, then, as a spiritual memoir, accomplishing deeply inward work through what would seem the very ordinary tasks of literary criticism&#x2014;working out linguistic puzzles, charting poetic breakthroughs, tracking down biographical details, holding on to these twenty-five poems over the course of a decade and allowing them to &#x201c;challenge and deepen my spiritual life, my beliefs and doubts.&#x201d;<br><br> &#x2014;Thomas Gardner, <i>Anglican Theological Review</i>&nbsp;</p><h2>September, September</h2><p>In September 1957 the South is mesmerized by events in Little Rock, Arkansas, whose governor has called out the National Guard as part of his attempt to halt the integration of Central High School.

The brief, radiant essays of&nbsp;<em>Classics Revisited</em> discuss sixty key books that are, for Rexroth, &#x201c;basic documents in the history of the imagination.&#x201d; Ranging from&nbsp;<em>The Epic of Gilgamesh</em>&nbsp;to&nbsp;<em>Huckleberry Finn</em>, these pieces (each about five pages long) originally appeared in the&nbsp;Saturday Review. Distinguished by Rexroth&#x2019;s plain, wide-awake style,&nbsp;Classics Revisited&nbsp;presents complex ideas in simple language, energized by the author&#x2019;s air of talking eye-to-eye with his reader. Elastic, at home in several languages, Rexroth is not bound by East or West; he leaps nimbly from Homer to The Mahabharata, from Lady Murasaki to Stendhal. It is only when we pause for breath that we notice his special affinities: for Casanova, lzaak Walton, Macbeth, Icelandic sagas, classical Japanese poetry. He has read everything. In Sterne, he sees traces of the Buddha; in Fielding, hints of Confucius. &#x201c;Life may not be optimistic,&#x201d; Rexroth maintains in his introduction, &#x201c;but it certainly is comic, and the greatest literature presents man wearing the two conventional masks; the grinning and the weeping faces that decorate theatre prosceniums.

They are men to whom rules did not apply; normal standards of behavior were simply too wearisome to worry about. These are men who brawled, boozed, snorted, and screwed their way into legendhood but along the way they changed acting and the way movies were made forever. <i>Hollywood Hellraisers</i> is a whistle-stop tour of jaw-dropping sexual activity, misbehavior of an Olympic standard, all-out excess, and genuine madness. It&#x2019;s a wonder Hollywood survived.</p><p><strong>Robert Sellers</strong> is a former stand-up comedian and the author of the biographies of Sting; Tom Cruise; Sean Connery; and the definitive book on Monty Python, <em>Always Look on the Bright Side of Life</em>.Sellers, a U.K. film writer and author of Hellraisers (on the lives of Richard Burton, Peter O&#x2122;Toole, Richard Harris, and Oliver Reed), turns his attention to the careers of another four "bad boys." A paragraph describing Brando on Broadway in A Streetcar Named Desire as "some women in the audience began hyperventilating" establishes the tabloid approach: what follows is a recounting of acid dreams, bad trips, amorous encounters, bedroom escapades, failed film projects, "creative differences" turned hostile, and family tragedies. Numerous pages detail the charismatic charm and sexual stamina of Beatty and Nicholson. The young Brando, according to Elia Kazan, was "a fuck machine," ending his life as a recluse whose &#x2dc;&#x2122;eccentricities took on a sinister tone." During years of "self-destructive hedonism,&#x2122;&#x2122; the wild-haired Hopper was a rebel, yet he survived to become part of the establishment, "almost Hollywood royalty, revered, iconic." Stirring together familiar and unfamiliar anecdotes--switching back and forth between actors with little transition--Sellers adds to the mix interviews he conducted with Hollywood insiders. 24 b&amp;w photos. <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The critics initially disliked it, but the public loved it. And eventually, the film took its rightful place as one of the most innovative, brilliant, and pivotal works of modern cinema. The Making of 2001: A Space Odyssey consists of testimony from Kubrick's collaborators and commentary from critics and historians. This is the most complete book on the film to date--from Stanley Kubrick's first meeting with screenwriter Arthur C. Clarke to Kubrick's exhaustive research to the actual shooting and release of the movie.</p><p>Stanley Kubrick (1928-1999) was born in the Bronx but lived and worked for most of his life in England. He made fifteen films including Lolita, A Clockwork Orange, Barry Lyndon and Full Metal Jacket.<br><br>Editor Stephanie Schwam has produced many documentary films and most recently worked with Peter Jennings on The Century Project.<b>SK<br><br><i>Jay Cocks</i></b><br><br>MGM is turning to real-estate parcels all around us, and that night I am facing Stanley Kubrick across the hood of a rented car in Culver City, and he is smiling at me, a little anxiously and still very proudly, and he is saying, "Yes, but did you like it?" <br><br>He means 2001. We have just seen it for the first time, he and I and perhaps a dozen others, in the cavernous studio screening room. Stanley's wife, Christiane, is with us. His attorney; the president of Cinerama; the film's editor, Ray Lovejoy, and a few others are also at the screening, but I am the only pair of fresh, disinterested eyes there. I am also, by at least two decades, the youngest member of the audience, an unelected representative of a generation that will eventually rescue this great film from critical infamy and claim it for its own. I am twenty-three years old, very lucky to be here, knowing it, sensing I have just seen something seismic whose full measure I can't take, reaching for something to say that will encompass all this, as well as my startled excitement at the wit and majesty of the movie. I am also trying to say something deeper and more memorable than "Wow" <br><br>I start to talk to Stanley and Christiane about the early days of silents, when movies were shown on rooftops, and audiences, watching a train on the screen come straight at them, ducked and screamed at the newness of the experience and, without knowing it, at intimations of the future. The experience of 2001 was, for me, just like that. <br><br>"Yeah," said Stanley, still smiling at my excitement, "but did you really like it?" <br><br>I told him it was one of the greatest things I'd ever seen, and he laughed, and we all drove to dinner.</p><h2>The Gnomes&#39; Winter Journey</h2><p><p>The woodland gnomes are excited to visit their cousins the mountain gnomes.

Three days later, he&#x2019;s found with a bullet in his head and a gun in his hand&#x2014;a discovery that sends tremors through this conservative community, already unnerved by growing rumors of Satanic worship in the region.</p><p>In the wake of this incident, bright but lonely Hannah Dexter is befriended by Lacey Champlain, a dark-eyed, Cobain-worshiping bad influence in lip gloss and Doc Martens. The charismatic, seductive Lacey forges a fast, intimate bond with the impressionable Dex, making her over in her own image and unleashing a fierce defiance that neither girl expected. But as Lacey gradually lures Dex away from her safe life into a feverish spiral of obsession, rebellion, and ever greater risk, an unwelcome figure appears on the horizon&#x2014;and Lacey&#x2019;s secret history collides with Dex&#x2019;s worst nightmare.</p><p>By turns a shocking story of love and violence and an addictive portrait of the intoxication of female friendship, set against the unsettled backdrop of a town gripped by moral panic, <em>Girls on Fire</em> is an unflinching and unforgettable snapshot of girlhood: girls lost and found, girls strong and weak, girls who burn bright and brighter&#x2014;and some who flicker away.</p></p><p><strong>An Amazon Best Book of May 2016:</strong> Much will be made of the fact that Robin Wasserman has previously written only Young Adult novels; the heroines (if you can call messed up, Kurt Cobain-obsessed, violent Hannah and Lacey that) of her first adult novel, <em>Girls on Fire</em>, are teenaged high school nonentities who set out to get revenge on the popular kids they&#x2019;re convinced despise them. But make no mistake: Hannah Dexter (also known as Dex, because Lacey thinks that makes her seem tougher) and her friends are involved in some pretty high stakes, grown up (and messed up) stuff, from booze and drugs (of course) to dangerous interactions with sometimes violent older men (ditto) to a climactic scene that even those of us who were blas� about those two previous examples didn&#x2019;t see coming. Written in language that can turn from incandescent to overblown, this thrilling novel juxtaposes some pretty terrible behavior with the ordinary goings-on in a completely ordinary town &#x2013; which makes it seem all the more realistic. It&#x2019;s almost embarrassing how firmly it grabbed me, and how grateful it made me both that I don&#x2019;t have any teenage daughters, and that I no longer am one. <em>&#x2014;Sara Nelson</em><p>Shortly after Halloween 1991, the local high-school basketball star is found in the woods near Battle Creek, Pennsylvania, with a bullet in his head and a gun in his hand&#x2014;a discovery that sends tremors through this conservative community, already unnerved by growing rumors of satanic worship in the region.<strong></strong></p><p>In the wake of this incident, bright but lonely Hannah Dexter is befriended by Lacey Champlain, a dark-eyed, Cobain-worshipping bad influence.

Around A.D. 640, Christian missionaries entered China from the west and had their message translated with a Taoist and Buddhist overlay. These sutras were eventually sealed in a cave, where they remained hidden for 900 years.<i>The Lost Sutras of Jesus</i> combines the amazing story of the writing, disappearance, and rediscovery of the sutras with an exploration of their message.</p><p>In 635 C.E. a small band of Christian monks traveled along the Silk Road from Persia to the imperial capital of China. Welcomed by the Tang Dynasty emperor, the missionaries set about translating into Chinese the sacred texts they had carried for 3000 miles across the deserts and mountains of Asia. <p>Influenced by Buddhists and Taoists they encountered along the way, the Persians translated their manuscripts into a collection of unique teachings, part Christianity and part Eastern wisdom, that combined the teachings of Jesus with the principles of Eastern thought. Recorded on a set of delicate scrolls, these new scriptures became known as the Jesus Sutras. </p><p>During the next few centuries, the political climate in China turned menacing towards Christians and Buddhists alike and sometime around 1000 C.E., the Jesus Sutras, together with thousands of Buddhist manuscripts, were hidden in a desert cave. </p><p>They were not seen again until 1900, when a Taoist monk restoring cave paintings in western China accidentally discovered the sealed cavern housing these priceless religious documents. Within a few years, European archaeologists and private collectors had removed the sacred texts from China, relegating them to academic obscurity for the next hundred years. Now, the new translation presented in this book offers a unique opportunity to delve into their unparalleled wisdom and tells the story of the discovery in 1998 of one of the monk's original monasteries.</p>Thomas Moore is a psychotherapist, writer and lecturer who lives in New England with his wife and two children.

He explores a range of issues arising from the economic phenomenon--increasing inequality and demands for use of an improved poverty definition. He focuses the story on the impact of the highly controversial welfare reform of 1996, passed by a Republican Congress and signed by a Democratic President Clinton, despite the laments of anguished liberals.</p><p>James T.

Rattled, Bird rushed home to Nova Scotia and enlisted in the army to take his dead brother&#39;s place. And We Go On is a remarkable and harrowing memoir of his two years in the trenches of the Western Front, from October 1916 until the Armistice. When it first appeared in 1930, Bird&#39;s memoir was hailed by many veterans as the most authentic account of the war experience, uncompromising in its portrayal of the horror and savagery, while also honouring the bravery, camaraderie, and unexpected spirituality that flourished among the enlisted men. Written in part as a reaction to anti-war novels such as All Quiet on the Western Front, which Bird criticized for portraying the soldier as &#34;a coarse-minded, profane creature, seeking only the solace of loose women or the courage of strong liquor,&#34; And We Go On is a nuanced response to the trauma of war, suffused with an interest in the spiritual and the paranormal not found in other war literature. Long out of print, it is a true lost classic that arguably influenced numerous works in the Canadian literary canon, including novels by Robertson Davies and Timothy Findley. In an introduction and afterword, David Williams illuminates Bird&#39;s work by placing it within the genre of Great War literature and by discussing the book&#39;s publication history and reception.</p><p>Will R. Bird (1891-1984) was a prolific author of history, travel writing, and fiction, best known for his books on the First World War and on the history of Nova Scotia. David Williams is professor emeritus at the University of Manitoba."A lost classic ? among the most powerful Canadian reactions to the Great War." Ian McKay and Robin Bates, In the Province of History: The Making of the Public Past in Twentieth-Century Nova Scotia<br><br>?And We Go On, originally published in 1930 and reissued to mark the 100th anniversary of the Great War, proves that Bird is a neglected master. As University of Manitoba English professor and unabashed fan David Williams argues in his introduction to the new edition, Bird ?should be required reading for all students of Canadian history and literature.?

Piece perfect points and petals with proven techniques, and then apply those skills to 13 mini Dresden projects from bed-size beauties to wallhangings and table toppers. A mix of easy and intermediate quilts includes a quilt-as-you-go project, tranquil color palettes, and subtle twists on traditional layouts.</p><p>Susan R. Marth has a background in architectural interior design, and today her quilt patterns, books, and templates are available worldwide. As part of her business, Suzn Quilts, she enjoys lecturing, teaching workshops, and designing fabric. She lives in Illinois.Miniature versions of the popular Dresden plate quilt block in both four-and-a-half and seven-inch sizes are the focus of quilt designer Marth's first collection. Scaled-down piecing calls for precision, and Marth includes plenty of tips for improving accuracy in cutting, pressing, and piecing. The 13 projects present Dresden plates in a variety of settings, using them both on their own and as part of larger blocks (such as the center of a churn dash) or layouts (a focal point for an Irish chain), and as full circles as well as half- and quarter-circles. The majority of the projects are miniquilts or wall hangings; there's also a lap-size quilt and a table runner. VERDICT Dresden plates are frequently seen in both modern and traditional quilting, and Marth's petite plates will inspire and challenge confident quilters.

Meanwhile, the other Holts face deadly challenges of their own: Jeff, as a prisoner of the Tlingit Indians in the frozen north; Melissa, in a new venture that sparks a violent rivalry; and Ned, caught in a life-and-death struggle on the high seas. Separated by miles and seemingly insurmountable obstacles, the Holts nonetheless battle together in spirit . . . united in their hopes for a burgeoning young nation and a promise they have sworn to keep.</p><p><b>Dana Fuller Ross</b> is a pseudonym for Noel Gerson, who wrote the Wagons West series under the name.In the conclusion to her Empire trilogy, set in the early 18th century, Ross brings to life the spirit and patriotism of the pioneering Holt family. Clay Holt is on a government mission to track the elusive Comte Jacques de la Carde, a French nobleman suspected of illegal land-grabbing schemes and of conspiring with hostile Indians. Saddled with a wife and child and besieged by foul weather, Holt continually remains a step behind his nemesis, and it seems that the U.S. government will lose the Western Territory to the New French Empire. After dropping off his family in a pioneer settlement, Clay, posing as a guide, rescues la Carde's group from an Indian attack and rather predictably spoils their plans. Fans of the series may be left hoping for more: Ross leaves the Holt affairs on an ambiguous note, with Clay's brother Jeff returning from an Indian settlement in Russian Alaska with a story of his own to tell. <p></p><p>Copyright 1999 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p><h2>Mishima: A Biography</h2><p>At forty-five, Yukio Mishima was the outstanding Japanese writer of his generation, celebrated both at home and abroad for <i>The Sailor Who Fell from Grace with the Sea</i>. In 1970 he startled the world by stepping out onto a balcony in Tokyo before an assembly of troops and plunging a sword into his abdomen; a disciple then beheaded him, completing the ritual of hara-kiri. John Nathan's riveting biography traces the life of this tortured, nearly superhuman personality. Mishima survived a grotesque childhood, and subsequently his sadomasochistic impulses became manifest&#x2014;as did an increasing obsession with death as the supreme beauty. Nathan, who knew Mishima professionally and personally, interviewed family, colleagues, and friends to unmask the various&#x2014;often seemingly contradictory&#x2014;personae of the genius who felt called by "a glittering destiny no ordinary man would be permitted."</p><p><b>John Nathan,</b> the Takashima Professor of Japanese Cultural Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, has translated the novels of both Yukio Mishima and the Nobel laureate Kenzaburo O�.

A Nobel laureate deeply beloved by his countrymen, Hamsun was now reviled as a traitor&#x2014;as long as his sanity was not called into question. <i>On Overgrown Paths</i> is Hamsun's apologia.<br><br>However, the psychiatric report declared him to be sane, but concluded that his mental faculties were "permanently impaired." This conclusion was emphatically refuted by the publication, in 1949, of <i>On Overgrown Paths</i>, Hamsun's apologia. In its creative �lan, this book, filled with the proud sorrow of an old man, miraculously recalls the spirit of Hamsun's early novels, with their reverence for nature, absurdist humor, and quirky flights of fancy.<br><br>This edition is the first authoritative English translation of Hamsun's last work, a work which stood at the center of the recent film <i>Hamsun.</i><br><br><b>Knut Hamsun</b> was the greatest 20th century Norwegian novelist, winner of the Nobel Prize, and enormously beloved when the country was occupied in World War II. During the war, however, his wife, a supporter of Quisling and the Nazis, traveled across the country reading from his work, particularly <i>Growth of the Soil</i>, which seemed to support notions of agrarian return by a superior Aryan peasant class. Old and confused, Hamsun traveled to Germany to meet with Hitler, hoping, he claimed, to change the conditions of occupation in Norway. The meeting ended disastrously, and after the war, Hamsun was arrested for his Nazi sympathy. As this book reveals, however, Hamsun was anything by mentally disturbed. It is a sad and tragic book filled with pained sorrow of an old man, great in stature and contribution, but completely out of touch with his own time.</p><p>Kurt Hamsun is a Nobel Prize-winning novelist.Text: English, Norwegian (translation)</p><h2>Trail of the Spellmans: Document #5</h2><p>The fifth in the critically acclaimed, <i>New York Times</i> bestselling, Edgar Award-nominated series about a fearless private investigator Izzy Spellman and her quirky, yet endearing, family of sleuths: &#x201c;Lie back and enjoy this tale of intergenerational gumshoe mayhem&#x201d; (Kirkus Reviews).<br><br>FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SPELLMAN HISTORY, Isabel Spellman, PI, might be the most normal member of her family.

The client can use the information however they see fit. At least that&#x2019;s the line I feed them. But the truth is always a murkier business.<br> <br>November 2<br> <br>2330 hrs<br> <br>Female subject, 5&#x2019;5&#x201d;, 125 lbs, dark brown hair, wearing blue jeans and a gray hooded sweatshirt over a dark green military jacket, exits a San Francisco apartment building at Twenty-sixth and Noe. She walks east down the street, scanning the parked cars. She presses a remote key and looks for a flash of headlights. A BMW winks in the distance. Female subject spins in a circle, checking her perimeter; approaches car; gets inside; and starts the engine. She drives east down to South Van Ness Avenue and makes a left turn, stopping on the corner of Seventeenth and South Van Ness at the establishment of Oscar&#x2019;s Auto. Subject drives vehicle into covered garage. Unable to establish a visual on subject for fifteen minutes.<br> <br>2345 hrs<br> <br>Subject and an unknown male (midforties, heavyset, wearing blue mechanic&#x2019;s jumpsuit with the Oscar&#x2019;s Auto logo embroidered on the breast pocket) exit the office of establishment. They approach a tow truck with the same logo painted on the side. Subject slips an unidentifiable object into her pocket and jumps into a truck with unknown male. Investigator follows subject vehicle to a liquor store. Unknown male enters the store and leaves three minutes later with a large brown bag (about the size of a six-pack of beer).1<br> <br>The tow truck returns subject to the residence on Twenty-sixth Street where she was previously seen exiting. Subject rings the buzzer. (Could not establish unit number.) Female subject then enters the building and all visual contact is lost.<br> <br> * * *<br> <br>The preceding events would appear innocent enough to the naked eye, but let me enlighten you as to what the naked eye missed just a few hours earlier that evening: Female Subject met the owner of the BMW in a bar; Female Subject was not of legal drinking age; Female Subject was not the owner of the vehicle taken to Oscar&#x2019;s repair shop. Finally&#x2014;and how could you know this?&#x2014;Oscar&#x2019;s Auto is a well-known chop shop, doing an arthritic limbo under the radar of the law. Subject, based on my three weeks of surveillance, was a regular menace to society, masquerading as a high-achieving coed.<br> <br> * * *<br> <br>My phone rang just as I was about to end the surveillance and head home. The caller ID said &#x201c;The Tortoise.&#x201d; Someone had been tampering with my phone.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hello,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where is everyone?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Dad.&#x201d; For the record, I wasn&#x2019;t withholding information.

I couldn&#x2019;t have agreed more.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m lonely.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Sorry to hear that, Mr. Tortoise.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And I hate my nickname.

Female subject peered out of the window, checking the empty street, and then defenestrated herself, hanging from the window frame and dropping four feet to the ground. She then sauntered down the street in the direction of her apartment, just over a mile away.<br> <br>After my conversation with the Tortoise, I made a quick U-turn and watched female subject through my rearview mirror. I had to ask myself whether I was doing my job or if I was an accessory after the fact.<br> <br> * * *<br> <br>At home, I found my father staring at a stack of paperwork that had to be filed. Filing always made him sad, borderline depressed, and since he thought he&#x2019;d seen the end of those days, to have them return only stoked his sadness. He pressed the intercom button when he saw me.<br> <br>&#x201c;The Gopher has landed,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I really wish you&#x2019;d stop that,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t,&#x201d; he helplessly replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Where&#x2019;s Mom?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>&#x201c;The Eagle2 is on the tarmac.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s just pathetic,&#x201d; I muttered as I left the room.<br> <br>The Eagle was indeed on the tarmac (or the couch, as it is commonly known), watching the evening news.<br> <br>On the drive to Spellman headquarters I debated, as I have over the last three months, how much information I should divulge. I&#x2019;m a spectacular liar (&#x201c;magician of the truth&#x201d; is the new phrase I&#x2019;m working with). I&#x2019;ve studied deception enough to know the universal tells, and I can embody honesty to virtually anyone, except a member of my family. With them I have to turn my behavior inside-out, assume a liarlike demeanor at all times&#x2014;toss in sarcasm with the truth. A salad of honesty and deception is the only way I can get away with an untruth. My point is that I was planning on lying to my parents about the evening&#x2019;s events and there is a particular way to go about it.<br> <br>&#x201c;Did the Sparrow flee the nest at all this evening?&#x201d; my mother asked, staring at the evening news.<br> <br>The Sparrow did indeed flee the nest, and another nest, and then she stole a car. With the right delivery, I could both manage a lie and have it read like the truth.<br> <br>&#x201c;Not unless you count a study break of grand theft auto,&#x201d; I sarcastically replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Write it up,&#x201d; said Mom. &#x201c;I think it might be time to tell the Blakes that this surveillance is merely a drain on their bank account.&#x201d;3<br> <br>&#x201c;Maybe we wait just a little bit longer,&#x201d; I replied.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why?&#x201d; my mother asked suspiciously. &#x201c;That doesn&#x2019;t sound like you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s finals week. She could be distracted.&#x201d;<br> <br>I fetched a beer from the fridge and sat down on the couch next to my mom.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t forget to write the report,&#x201d; Mom said. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s always better to do it when it&#x2019;s fresh in your mind.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c; &#x2018;Subject remained in her apartment for five hours studying.&#x2019; &#x201d; I spoke as if into a tape recorder. &#x201c;It shouldn&#x2019;t take very long to type that up.&#x201d;<br> <br>Silence finally set in.<br> <br>Television is the perfect anecdote for unwanted conversation. I don&#x2019;t know how humans ever survived without it.<br> <br>After a few bars of the grating evening-news theme song, an earnest middle-aged man related a story about a brutal triple-murder-followed-by-suicide in Vallejo. He looked appropriately grave for two full seconds and then turned to his female counterpart.<br> <br>She nodded, furrowed her brow, and said, &#x201c;A tragedy . . . And now, I believe we have some breaking news about the tree sitters in Berkeley.&#x201d;<br> <br>The camera shifted to the image of a khaki-and-windbreaker-clad newscaster in front of the oak grove on the UC Berkeley campus. Over the hum of protesters and bullhorns, the newscaster shouted into the microphone.<br> <br>&#x201c;For a week now, tree sitters working in shifts have lived on the three-hundred-year-old oak tree in protest of a campus development project that would require the trees&#x2019; removal. Negotiations began last week but have stalled . . . University officials are once again at odds with the environmental activists who have proven to be worthy adversaries in the past . . . &#x201d;<br> <br>Just then my father entered the room and planted himself next to me on the couch. &#x201c;You have to admire their dedication,&#x201d; he said.<br> <br>&#x201c;I want to know when they use the restroom,&#x201d; my mother said.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s what the bucket is for,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>The newscaster continued his report.<br> <br>&#x201c;. . . The tree sitters have managed to maintain a constant vigil by working in shifts. In the middle of the night there was a changing of the guards, when the police were called away by a disturbance in the sculpture garden . . . &#x201d;<br> <br>The camera panned over to one of the grand old oaks and closed in on the tree sitter du jour. The reporter continued. &#x201c;Currently the police are trying to find a safe and peaceful way to end the standoff. We will keep you posted on the latest developments.&#x201d;<br> <br>The news cut to an Ivory Soap commercial. My mother picked up her cell phone, pressed number three on her speed dial, and waited until the voice mail kicked in.<br> <br>&#x201c;Rae. This is your mother calling. Get the hell out of that tree right now!&#x201d;<br> <br>1. I have an eye for this sort of thing.<br> <br>2. I&#x2019;ll explain all this animal crap shortly.<br> <br>3.

A preeminent political scientist examines the past, present, and future of an endangered political philosophy</b><br>Since the end of World War II, democracy's sweep across the globe seemed inexorable. Yet today, it seems radically imperiled, even in some of the world's most stable democracies. How bad could things get?<br>In <i>How Democracy Ends</i>, David Runciman argues that we are trapped in outdated twentieth-century ideas of democratic failure. By fixating on coups and violence, we are focusing on the wrong threats. Our societies are too affluent, too elderly, and too networked to fall apart as they did in the past. We need new ways of thinking the unthinkable--a twenty-first-century vision of the end of democracy, and whether its collapse might allow us to move forward to something better.<br>A provocative book by a major political philosopher, <i>How Democracy Ends</i> asks the most trenchant questions that underlie the disturbing patterns of our contemporary political life.</p><p><b>David Runciman</b> is a professor of politics at Cambridge University.

In this bracing reckoning, the brilliant David Runciman asks a series of questions whose answers take him from Hobbes to Gandhi, from the Colosseum to Facebook. A searching and urgent book."&#x2015;<b><i><b>Jill Lepore, author of <i>These Truths: A History of the United States</i></b></i></b><br><br>"As our advanced democracies wither, David Runciman suggests we may have been looking in the wrong places to understand what is happening.

In 527 CE he was made legal adviser and secretary of Belisarius, commander against the Persians, and went with Belisarius again in 533 against the Vandals and in 535 against the Ostrogoths. Sometime after 540 he returned to Constantinople. He may have been that Procopius who was prefect of Constantinople in 562, but the date of his death (after 558) is unknown.</p><p>Procopius's <i>History of the Wars</i> in 8 books recounts the Persian Wars of emperors Justinus and Justinian down to 550 (2 books); the Vandalic War and after-events in Africa 532&#x2013;546 (2 books); the Gothic War against the Ostrogoths in Sicily and Italy 536&#x2013;552 (3 books); and a sketch of events to 554 (1 book). The whole consists largely of military history, with much information about peoples and places as well, and about special events. He was a diligent, careful, judicious narrator of facts and developments and shows good powers of description. He is just to the empire's enemies and boldly criticises emperor Justinian. Other works by Procopius are the <i>Anecdota</i> or <i>Secret History</i>&#x2014;vehement attacks on Justinian, Theodora, and others; and <i>The Buildings of Justinian</i> (down to 558 CE) including roads and bridges as well as churches, forts, hospitals, and so on in various parts of the empire.</p><p>The Loeb Classical Library edition of Procopius is in seven volumes.</p></p><p><p>Henry Bronson Dewing (1882&#x2013;1956) was Professor of Greek at Bowdoin College and President of Athens College.</p></p><h2>Black Eyed Blonde</h2><p><p>"SOMEWHERE RAYMOND CHANDLER IS SMILING . . . I LOVED THIS BOOK. IT WAS LIKE HAVING AN OLD FRIEND, ONE YOU ASSUMED WAS DEAD, WALK INTO THE ROOM."&#x2015;<b>Stephen King</b><br><b></b><br>"It was one of those summer Tuesday afternoons when you begin to wonder if the earth has stopped revolving." So begins a new novel featuring Philip Marlowe&#x2015;yes, <i>that </i>Philip Marlowe. Channeling Raymond Chandler, Benjamin Black has brought Marlowe back to life for a new adventure on the mean streets of Bay City, California. It is the early 1950s, Marlowe is as restless and lonely as ever, and business is a little slow. Then a new client is shown in: blond, beautiful, and expensively dressed, she wants Marlowe to find her former lover. Almost immediately, Marlowe discovers that the man's disappearance is merely the first in a series of bewildering events, and soon he is tangling with one of Bay City's richest&#x2015;and most ruthless&#x2015;families.<br> Only Benjamin Black, a modern master of the genre, could write a new Philip Marlowe novel that has all the panache and charm of the originals while delivering a story that is as sharp and fresh as today's best crime fiction.</p></p><p><b>Benjamin Black</b> is the pen name of the Man Booker Prize-winning novelist John Banville. The author of the bestselling and critically acclaimed series of Quirke novels&#x2015;including <i>Christine Falls</i>, <i>Vengeance</i>, and <i>Holy Orders</i>&#x2015;he lives in Dublin.<p>&#x201c;A bulll's-eye.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The New York Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Somewhere Raymond Chandler is smiling . . . I loved this book. It was like having an old friend, one you assumed was dead, walk into the room.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Stephen King</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Black] has revived Chandler's legendary PI Philip Marlowe in a new adventure . . . A perfume heiress hires the shamus to investigate the disappearance of her lover, and the mystery soon opens up under him like a sinkhole . . . Black manages to nail not only Marlowe's voice, but his soul.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Entertainment Weekly</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Black] channeling Chandler is irresistible--a double whammy of a mystery. Hard to think anyone could add to Chandler with profitable results. But [Black] most definitely gets it done.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Richard Ford</i></p><p>&#x201c;Terrific fun . . . <i>The Black-Eyed Blonde</i> could be passed off as a newly discovered Chandler manuscript found in some dusty La Jolla closet . . . Any fan of Chandler's work is going to enjoy it.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The New York Times Book Review</i></p><p>&#x201c;Half the pleasure of this book, at least for a Chandler fan, is to notice Black getting the little things right . . . Against a dozen other detective novels on my desk, I'll take a Raymond Chandler any day of the week, even when its written by somebody else--assuming that somebody is Benjamin Black.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>All Things Considered, NPR</i></p><p>&#x201c;It's vintage L.A., toots: The hot summer, rain on the asphalt, the woman with the lipstick, cigarette ash and alienation, V8 coupes, tough guys, snub-nosed pistols, the ice melting in the bourbon . . . The results are Chandleresque, sure, but you can see [Black's] sense of fun.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Washington Post</i></p><p>&#x201c;I opened the book hopefully--and I closed it entirely satisfied, even thrilled . . . It's all there, the Chandler voice: the crisply detailed description and sly similes that set a scene precisely, the world-weary bemusement of the narrator, his gimlet eye for the ladies and the delicately ominous foreshadowing . . . It's clear [Black] does love Marlowe, and he's reminded me why I love him, too.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Tampa Bay Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;From its pitch-perfect opening sentences, Benjamin Black's channeling of Raymond Chandler is one of the season's best mysteries.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The San Francisco Chronicle</i></p><p>&#x201c;I was impressed by the plotting of <i>The Black-Eye Blonde</i>, its perfect pacing and use of misdirection . . . [Black] nails the spoiled L.A. atmosphere that is Chandler's forte.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Salon.com</i></p><p>&#x201c;A tremendously fun and diverting tale . . . The author of a somber but beautifully written series of mysteries set in the same era as Chandler's novels, Black was a savvy choice for the job. His nimble plotting drives <i>The Black-Eyed Blonde . . . </i>Marlowe, however, remains the undisputed star of the show, a hardened, magnetic presence.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Page Views, New York Daily News</i></p><p>&#x201c;All of the essential ingredients are there, afloat in a tumbler of Santa Monica sleaze . . . But Mr. Black can also make words do things Chandler could only dream of . . . The fun lies in watching two styles tangle . . . With an artfulness worthy of the original, Mr. Black has made it new, though he doesn't forget whom he owes.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The New York Observer</i></p><p>&#x201c;What Black captures in Chandler's voice is the weary twist of ambivalence . . . That baseline of doubt, the whiff of regret and then betrayal, form the essential atmosphere of noir fiction. And Black gets that exactly right.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Oregonian</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Black] has largely perfected Chandler's much-mimicked, seldom-bettered knack for similes and one-liners . . . Best of all, though, he conjures the world-weary loneliness of Chandler's creation, a character who, in just seven novels, the world saw far too little of. Banville/Black clearly loves writing this and the fun he's having--his affection for Chandler's world--shines through . . . Entirely irresistible.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Guardian (UK)</i></p><p>&#x201c;[<i>The Black-Eyed Blonde</i>] is probably better than an actual Chandler: more coherent, and more consistent, more careful. [Black] is simply a more elegant writer. Chandler was a metaphorical rogue trader; [Black] is a class act.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The New Statesman (UK)</i></p><p>&#x201c;[The fact that] this novel is so enjoyable is a testament to the effectiveness of the formula that Chandler laboured so hard to perfect.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Telegraph (UK)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Seen as a crime novel in its own right it is a cut above anything else out there.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Irish Times</i></p><p>&#x201c;Black's Marlowe caper is in a separate league. It is wonderful, an affectionate tribute and a labour of love that is sure to please Chandler devotees and endear new audiences.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The National (Abu Dhabi)</i></p><p>&#x201c;Black skillfully references Chandler characters ... [and] remarkably, he seems to channel Chandler's cadence with pithy dialogue, beautifully drawn characters, and a satisfyingly convoluted plot.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Alfred Hitchcock's Mystery Magazine</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Black] brings Raymond Chandler's Philip Marlowe back to full-blooded life--complete with inner turmoil and honest, hard-boiled dialogue. This is not a pastiche, but the real deal, kicked up a notch with clever traces of irony. It's tightly plotted, has its share of blunt violence and wise-cracks, as well as descriptions of L.A. that puncture the city's elaborate fa�ade. Banville has been compared to Joyce, and this novel confirms the comparison. You'll find memorable passages that demand to be read aloud. [Banville's prose] captures perfectly the melancholy soul of Philip Marlowe.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Zoom Street Magazine</i></p><p>&#x201c;Despite Robert B. Parker's lengthy experience in the PI genre, his sequel to <i>The Big Sleep</i>, Perchance to Dream, pales in comparison with Black's pitch-perfect recreation of the character and his time and place. As for the language, Black nails Chandler's creative and memorable similes and metaphors.... While the mystery is well-plotted, Black elevates it beyond mere thoughtful homage with a plausible injection of emotion in his wounded lead.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly (boxed and starred review)</i></p><p>&#x201c;[Black] offers a stylish homage to Raymond Chandler in this tightly written caper . . . The focus . . . is on style and mood, and the Irishman, perhaps surprisingly, nails both. The homage game is a tricky game to play, but Black makes all the right moves. Great fun for Chandlerians.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Booklist</i></p><p>&#x201c;Black . . . deliver[s] a more complex and satisfying mystery than other authors have done in the past. This latest incarnation of Chandler's sleuth with appeal to fans of Chandler and Marlowe, but newcomers to one of the first great PIs in crime fiction will find much to enjoy here as well.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Library Journal</i></p><p>&#x201c;A treat for fans.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p></p><h2>Salvations: Truth and Difference in Religion (Faith Meets Faith Series)</h2><p>For more than a century Christian theologians have attempted to construct "theologies of religion" that would be recognized as authentically Christian and authentic in relation to the historical and social reality of many religions. This attempt usually ends in an impasse in which either only one religion is portrayed as holding the true path to salvation, or that many do. Neither the exclusivist nor the pluralist position is completely satisfactory in integrating the two goals of an authentically Christian and historically viable theology of religions.<br>In calling this book Salvations author S. Mark Heim moves the theology of religions project beyond taking sides on exclusivist and pluralist views. The crux of his argument is this: that it makes more sense to speak of salvation in the plural, to maintain that the ends of various religions are indeed varied and significantly constituted by the paths taken to reach them. At the same time, all paths - Christianity included - can and must make or require exclusive commitments on the part of those that hold them.<br>One of the most intriguing features of Salvations is its careful critique of the pluralist assumption of a single religious end to the many religions. Heim's careful analysis of the writings of John Hick, Wilfred Cantwell Smith, and Paul Knitter points out a central weakness in the pluralist argument: by insisting that different religions point to the same "ultimate," pluralism fails its own test of plurality. Heim points out that exclusivists should note that in hypothesizing the many ends of different religions, Salvations contradicts neither the finality of Christ, nor the authentic, independent validity of other religions.</p><p>S. Mark Heim is professor of theology at Andover Newton Theological Seminary.</p><h2>William Dudley Pelley: A Life in Right-Wing Extremism and the Occult (Religion and Politics)</h2><p>William Dudley Pelley was one of the most important figures of the anti-Semitic radical right in the twentieth century. Best remembered as the leader of the paramilitary "Silver Shirts," Pelley was also an award-winning short story writer, Hollywood screenwriter, and religious leader. During the Depression Pelley was a notorious presence in American politics; he ran for president on a platform calling for the ghettoization of American Jews and was a defendant in a headlinegrabbing sedition trial thanks to his unwavering support for Nazi Germany. <br><br>Scott Beekman offers not only a political but also an intellectual and literary biography of Pelley, greatly advancing our understanding of a figure often dismissed as a madman or charlatan. His belief system, composed of anti-Semitism, economic nostrums, racialism, neo-Theosophical channeling, and millenarian Christianity, anticipates the eclecticism of later cult personalities such as Shoko Asahara, leader of Aum Shinrikyo, and the British conspiracy theorist David Icke. <br><br>By charting the course of Pelley's career, Beekman does an admirable job of placing Pelley within the history of both the anti-Semitic right and American occult movements. This exhaustively researched book is a welcome addition to the growing body of scholarship on American extremism and esoteric religions.</p><p>Scott Beekman is visiting assistant professor of history at Ohio University.&#34;Likely to stand as the authoritative work on Pelley. [Beekman] has done a wonderful job of constructing the complex narrative of Pelley&#39;s life--a life with some striking continuities but also numerous zigzags.&#34;</p><h2>Down South Paleo: Delectable Southern Recipes Adapted for Gluten-free, Paleo Eaters</h2><p><p><b>Delicious Paleo Comfort Food Dishes from the Heart of the South</b></p><p>Being Paleo doesn't mean you have to skimp on Southern cooking.

Of course it could also be miserable: fog, filthy streets, shabby hovels where too many people live in too few rooms. Schlitz conjures both the magic and the mundane here. . . .Schlitz uses such evocative language that readers will practically smell dirty London and then be relieved by the crisp, cold air in the countryside around the witch&#x2019;s crumbling mansion. The characters are recognizable tropes: the witch is rotting from the inside out; the orphans may be dirty and ill-bred, but they have spirit and pluck; the little rich girl is actually sad and lonely; the skinny puppeteer and the overly dramatic landlady are recognizably Dickensian. Yet, they are so well drawn that they are never caricatures, but people whom readers will cheer for, be terrified of, or grow to like. The plot is rich with supernatural and incredibly suspenseful elements. Fans of mystery, magic, and historical fiction will all relish this novel.<br>&#x2014;School Library Journal (starred review)<br><br>In this not-quite-parody novel Schlitz takes the conventions of melodrama and fleshes them out with toothsome scene setting and surprising, original character details. The two heroes are fine foils for each other, the Victorian-good Lizzie Rose versus the street-pragmatic Parsefall. Grisini, with his back story in Venice, is pure moustache-twirling evil, and Cassandra is an intriguing portrait of bitter, regretful old age and bone-deep malevolence. . .

Jones' message has been that Appalachia should be judged by its own core values - family, land, traditionalism - rather than by more mainstream values of accumulation, wealth and power, Eller said. &#x201c;In many ways, he represents the best of Appalachia, the part of Appalachian society that values people for what they really are.&#x201d; In his years of writing and speaking about the region, Jones has become one of its best-known and best-loved figures. In addition to the numerous articles he has written about Appalachia, he has also authored nine books, including multiple volumes on regional humor.<br><br><strong>Billy Edd Wheeler Bio: </strong><br><br><p>Billy Edd Wheeler was born on December 9, 1932.

How can you determine appropriate plants for a particular site? How can you use their distinct design features effectively? What are the real design considerations to keep in mind?<br><br> This book&#x2015;a Botany 101 course for professionals and students alike&#x2015;walks you through all the answers, equipping you with the ability to be not just an informed landscape designer but also an effective planting designer.<br><br> Kimberly Duffy Turner, a landscape architect and horticulturalist, explains the essentials of planting design, exploring form and function and showing how various characteristics of plants and trees&#x2015;shape, pigment, leaf veination, texture, fragrance, sound, height, and more&#x2015;can be used to achieve effective site-appropriate designs. Specifying appropriate plant material and examining stock at the nursery&#x2015;drawing up a planting schedule of the species or cultivar, sizes, and quantities&#x2015;and evaluating modes of transplantation (when to ask for bare root, balled and burlapped, or containerized) are other key &#x201c;on-the-job&#x201d; concepts covered.<br><br> A chapter on green design outlines some of the sustainable trends in botany: the role of LEED certification in landscape design; mitigating environmental problems with plants and open space; the emergence of green roofs and vertical gardens; biomimicry; and sensitive material selection, like composite wood products and plant-derived, soy-based paints. Both a handy appendix of common Latin and Greek terms used in horticulture and a comprehensive list of plant palettes are included.<br><br> With more than 150 color photographs and schematic drawings illustrating key strategies, <em>Botany for Designers</em> is the professional&#x2019;s go-to guide, showing you how an appreciation of plant fundamentals can lead to more inspired, well-designed landscapes. 175 full-color photographs</p><p><strong>Kimberly Duffy Turner</strong> is a principal at a Boston-based landscape architecture firm, and she developed and taught a related course at the Boston Architectural College.

In this extraordinary new book, his first work of nonfiction, he searches for the connections between the worlds of art and technology. Coders are obsessed with elegance and style, just as writers are, but do the words mean the same thing to both? Can we ascribe beauty to the craft of writing code?<br>Exploring such varied topics as logic gates and literary modernism, the machismo of tech geeks, the omnipresence of an "Indian Mafia" in Silicon Valley, and the writings of the eleventh-century Kashmiri thinker Abhinavagupta,<i>Geek Sublime</i> is both an idiosyncratic history of coding and a fascinating meditation on the writer's art. Part literary essay, part technology story, and part memoir, it is an engrossing, original, and heady book of sweeping ideas.</p></p><p><p><b>Vikram Chandra</b> is the author of three highly acclaimed works of fiction, most recently<i>Sacred Games</i>, which won the 2006 Hutch Crossword Award.

Its ambition: to look deeply, and with great subtlety, into the connections and tensions between the worlds--the cultures--of technology and art.

Grounding his argument in Scripture and in the experience of Holocaust survivors and of survivors of child abuse, Blumenthal grapples with how to face a God who has worked "wondrously through us" and who has worked "aw(e)fully against us." Delving into Jewish literary and theological traditions, the author articulates a theology of protest which accepts God as God is, yet defends the innocence of those who are utterly victimized.</p></p><p><b>David R.

Refusing to read the letter of James through the lens ofPaul, Hartin approaches the letter in its own right. He takes seriously the address to the twelve tribes in the Dispersion&#34; (1:1) as directed to Jews who had embraced the message of Jesus and were living outside their homeland, Israel. At the same time, Hartin shows how this letter remains true to Jesus&#39; heritage. Using recent studies on rhetorical culture, Hartin illustrates how James takes Jesus &#39; sayings and performs them again in his own way to speak to the hearers/readers of his own world.Hartin examines the text, passage by passage, while providing essential notes and an extensive explanation of the theological meaning of each passage. The value of this commentary lies in its breadth of scholarship and its empathic approach to this writing. The reader will discover new and refreshing insights into the world of early Christianity as well as a teaching that is of perennial significance.Patrick J. Hartin was born and raised in Johannesburg, South Africa. He studied at the Gregorian University in Rome and is an ordained priest of the Diocese of Spokane, Washington. He holds two doctorates in Theology: in Ethics and in the New Testament, both from the University of South Africa. Presently he teaches courses in the New Testament and in Classical Civilizations at Gonzaga University. He is the author of eleven books, including: Apollos (Paul&#39;s Social Network series), James of Jerusalem (Interfaces series), andJames, First Peter, Jude, Second Peter (New Collegeville Bible Commentary series), al published by Liturgical Press.&#34;</p><p>The Letter of James provides an important message that challenges us as Christians to put faith into action. In this commentary Patrick Hartin provides a new translation of James that serves as the basis for a detailed explanation of the text. He shows that it is an important writing that sheds light and understanding onto the world of early Christianity. Section by section he provides essential and illuminating notes on the text and its content. This treatment culminates in an extensive explanation of the theological meaning of James within its own context as well as its application for today?s reader. A detailed bibliography follows each section enabling readers to pursue further interests.?Hartin has produced a commentary well worth having on one?s shelf.? Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society?H?s James is a resounding success. His commentary represents the ?state of the art? in research on the letter of James ? The Catholic Biblical Review ?An established authority on the Epistle of St. James, Professor Patrick J. Hartin offers a most comprehensive and yet lucid commentary on one of the most important writings in the New Testament canon, shrouded in its own mystery and conflicting interpretations. Hartin adapts an interdisciplinary approach to St. James. . . . By applying the insights of cultural studies and rhetorical argumentation, Hartin provides a persuasive case for a renewed attention to the Epistle of St. James as a paradigm for ?spiritual perfection? in the context of the holy liturgy revealing God as the ?giver of all good gifts.?? Jon Ma. Asgeirsson Professor of New Testament Studies and Early Christianity University of Iceland?Hartin not only brings the full resources of historical criticism to bear on James, but also treats the letter with careful attention to its rhetorical structure, situation, and argumentation, and with sensibilities to the cultural scripts of Jews living in the ancient Mediterranean. This combination of rhetorical and social-science approaches make for a reading that both situates James appropriately in its ancient, and therefore somewhat foreign, cultural setting, and shows how James spoke powerfully in the setting. Though filled with erudition and engaging a wide body of scholarly literature, Hartin&#39;s work is lucid, direct, and lively.? John S. Kloppenborg Professor of Religion University of Toronto?The superb Sacra Pagina series is nearly complete with the appearance of this commentary on the Letter of James. This latest addition maintains the fine quality and helpful format of the series, with a fresh, literal translation of the biblical text, detailed commentary, and broader theological reflection on the message of the text.? The Bible Today?The commentary is readable and well organized. . . . Hartin?s commentary is a worthy addition to the Sacra Pagina series.? Toronto Journal of Theology?. . . a substantial and worthy addition to the series and is sure to be useful to a wide range of readers. . . . Hartin succeeds in reading James on its own terms and does a fine job of opening up some of the richness of this small but powerful composition.

One day, Cang Jie, a historical official who tied knots to keep records under Yellow Emperor, unexpectedly made a big mistake. Feeling very guilty, he was determined to find out a better way for keeping records. He went back to his hometown to think it over for many days and nights. Inspired by the footprints of animals, he began to carefully observe the sun, moon, stars, mountains, rivers, lakes, seas, as well as birds and animals. At the same time, he traveled around collecting signs created by fishermen, farmers, hunters and soldiers. In the end, he succeeded in creating Chinese characters, which are still widely used today. <br><br>In this multicultural children's story, kids will find out that there is a story behind every Chinese character. Children will also learn about basic Chinese characters and how to make them.</p><p><b>Li Jian</b> graduated from Hebei Normal University in 2001, majoring in Chinese painting.

According to Saivagama, the divine consciousness is not simply cold, inert intellection. It is rather spanda, active, dynamic, throbbing with life, creative pulsation. In Siva-sutras, it is the prakasa aspect of the divine that is emphasized; in Spandakarikas, it is the vimarsa aspect that is emphasized. Together, these two books give us integral view of Saivai philosophy. Ksemaraja has written a commentary on Spandakarikas, titled Spandanirnaya. He is fond of sesquipedalian compounds, long and windy sentences, but he is very profound in the comprehension of the subject and so cannot be ignored. The author tried to provide a readable translation of both the karikas and the Spanda-nirnaya commentary. Each karika (verse) is given both in Devanagari and Roman script, followed by its translation in English. This is followed by Ksemaraja s commentary in Sanskrit. Then follows an English translation of the commentary. After this, copious notes are added on important and technical words. Finally, a running exposition of each karika in author s own words given.</p><p>Jaideva Singh (1893-1986) was a great scholar in musicology, philosophy and Sanskrit. A former principal of Y.d.

It is absolute ballad put to page.&#x201d; -Southern LivingLewis Nordan's fiction invents its own world--always populated by madly heroic misfits. In Music of the Swamp, he focuses his magic and imagination on a boy's utterly helpless love for his utterly hopeless father--a man who attracts bad luck like a magnet. Nordan evokes ten-year-old Sugar Mecklin's world with dazzling clarity: the smells, the tastes, and most surely the sounds of life in this peculiar, somewhat bizarre, Delta town. Sugar discovers that what his daddy says is true: &#x201c;The Delta is filled up with death&#x201d;; but he also finds an endless supply of hope.An Ala Notable BookMississippi Institute of Arts and Letters Fiction Award</p><p><p>Lewis Nordan was a professor of creative writing at the University of Pittsburgh for many years and the author of seven books of fiction and a memoir. His awards include three American Library Association Notable Book citations, the Mississippi Institute of Arts and Letters Award for fiction, the Mississippi Authors Award for fiction, and the Southern Book Critics Award for fiction. He died in 2012.</p>In Nordan's third collection (Welcome to the Arrow-Catcher Fair, 1983; The All-Girl Football Team, 1986)--interrelated stories about Sugar Mecklin's enchanted 11th year--spooky memento mori haunt the child's world of the town of Arrow Catcher on the Mississippi Delta. Sugar and a pal find a dead man's body in the surrounding swamp, where ``mice sing'' and a wading cow bellows in a tenor voice; then, with a folding shovel, Sugar unearths what seems to be a well-preserved female corpse in a glass coffin beneath his parents' house. He rides on a ``snail-slow freight train'' back and forth to Greenville, where the first electrocution in recent Mississippi history is scheduled to take place, and about which- -because a black man has been condemned to death--no one but Sugar seems to care. Later, Sugar's father, with the boy in tow, having dropped in at the local drugstore to pick up a hangover remedy, accidentally administers a fatal dose of morphine to his friend, the addicted druggist. Meanwhile, the same father, a sweet man who never seems able to say or do what he intends, drinks alcoholically every afternoon; and Sugar's mother, who loves both of them to distraction, sadly laments for the boy's father's drunkenness and ill luck. None of this black-humored drama is uncommon to southern fiction, but Nordan brings wit, warmth, elegance, grace, and an original, persuasive love of his hidebound, inarticulate characters to territory previously covered by Faulkner, O'Connor, and especially (A Member of the Wedding) McCullers. Not the first to get where it goes: but, even so, a wonderful and memorable collection. -- <i>Copyright �1991, Kirkus Associates, LP.

Now she has married a man she adores, whose heritage can be traced back to the Mayflower, and she is about to give birth to their first child. But what should be the happiest day of her life becomes the day her world falls apart. Her daughter is born beautiful and healthy, and in addition, unmistakably African-American in appearance. Dana&#x2019;s determination to discover the truth about her baby&#x2019;s heritage becomes a shocking, poignant journey. A superbly crafted novel, <i>Family Tree </i>asks penetrating questions about family and the choices people make in times of crisis.</p><p>BARBARA DELINSKY<b> </b>is a <i>New York Times</i> bestselling author with more than thirty million copies of her books in print. She lives with her family in New England.Chapter 1<br>Something woke her mid&#x2013;dream. She didn't know whether it was the baby kicking, a gust of sea air tumbling in over the sill, surf breaking on the rocks, or even her mother's voice, liquid in the waves, but as she lay there open&#x2013;eyed in bed in the dark, the dream remained vivid. It was an old dream, and no less embarrassing to her for knowing the script. She was out in public, for all the world to see, lacking a vital piece of clothing. In this instance, it was her blouse. She had left home without it and now stood on the steps of her high school&#x2014;her high school&#x2014;wearing only a bra, and an old one at that. It didn&#x2019;t matter that she was sixteen years past graduation and knew none of the people on the steps. She was exposed and thoroughly mortified. And then&#x2014;this was a first&#x2014;there was her mother&#x2013;in&#x2013;law, standing off to the side, wearing a look of dismay and carrying&#x2014;bizarre&#x2014;the blouse.<br><br>Dana might have laughed at the absurdity of it, if, at that very moment, something else hadn&#x2019;t diverted her thoughts. It was the sudden rush of fluid between her legs, like nothing she had ever felt before.<br><br>Afraid to move, she whispered her husband&#x2019;s name. When he didn&#x2019;t reply, she reached out, shook his arm, and said in full voice, &#x201c;Hugh?&#x201d;<br><br>He managed a gut&#x2013;low &#x201c;Mm?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We have to get up.&#x201d;<br><br>She felt him turn and stretch.<br><br>&#x201c;My water just broke.&#x201d;<br><br>He sat up with a start. Leaning over her, his deep voice higher than normal, he asked, &#x201c;Are you sure?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It keeps coming. But I&#x2019;m not due for two weeks.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That's okay,&#x201d; he reassured her, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s okay. The baby is seven&#x2013;plus pounds&#x2014;right in the middle of the full&#x2013;term range. What time is it?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;One&#x2013;ten.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t move. I&#x2019;ll get towels.&#x201d; He rolled away and off the bed.<br><br>She obeyed him, partly because Hugh had studied every aspect of childbirth and knew what to do, and partly to avoid spreading the mess. As soon as he returned, though, she supported her belly and pushed herself up. Squinting against the sudden light of the lamp, she took one of the towels, slipped it between her legs, and shuffled into the bathroom.<br><br>Hugh appeared seconds later, wide&#x2013;eyed and pale in the vanity lights. &#x201c;What do you see?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>&#x201c;No blood. But it&#x2019;s definitely the baby and not me.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you feel anything?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Like terror?&#x201d; She was dead serious. As prepared as they were&#x2014;they had read dozens of books, talked with innumerable friends, grilled the doctor and her partners and her nurse&#x2013;practitioner and the hospital personnel during a pre&#x2013;admission tour&#x2014;the reality of the moment was something else. With childbirth suddenly and irrevocably imminent, Dana was scared.<br><br>&#x201c;Like contractions,&#x201d; Hugh replied dryly.<br><br>&#x201c;No. Just a funny feeling. Maybe a vague tightening.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;What does &#x2018;vague&#x2019; mean?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Subtle.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Is it a contraction?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don't know.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Does it come and go?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, Hugh. Really. I just woke up and then there was a gush&#x2014;&#x201d; She broke off, feeling something. &#x201c;A cramp.&#x201d; She held her breath, let it out, met his eyes. &#x201c;Very mild.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Cramp or contraction?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Contraction,&#x201d; she decided, starting to tremble. They had waited so long for this. They were as ready as they would ever be.<br><br>&#x201c;Are you okay while I call the doctor?&#x201d; he asked.<br><br>She nodded, knowing that if she hadn&#x2019;t he would have brought the phone into the bathroom. But she wasn&#x2019;t helpless. As doting as Hugh had been lately, she was an independent sort, and by design. She knew what it was to be wholly dependent on someone and then have her taken away. It didn&#x2019;t get much worse.<br><br>So, while he phoned the doctor, she fit her big belly into her newest, largest warm&#x2013;up suit, now lined with a pad from her post-delivery stash to catch amniotic fluid that continued to leak, and went down the hall to the baby&#x2019;s room. She had barely turned on the light when he called.<br><br>&#x201c;Dee?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;In here!&#x201d;<br><br>Buttoning jeans, he appeared at the door. His dark hair was mussed, his eyes concerned. &#x201c;"If those pains are less than ten minutes apart, we&#x2019;re supposed to head to the hospital. Are you okay?&#x201d;<br><br>She nodded. &#x201c;Just want a last look.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s perfect, honey,&#x201d; he said as he stretched into an old navy tee shirt. &#x201c;All set?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I don't think they&#x2019;re less than ten minutes apart.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;They will be by the time we&#x2019;re halfway there.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;This is our first,&#x201d; she argued. &#x201c;First babies take longer.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;That may be the norm, but every norm has exceptions. Indulge me on this, please?&#x201d;<br><br>Taking his hand, she kissed his palm and pressed it to her neck. She needed another minute.<br><br>She felt safe here, sheltered, happy. Of all the nurseries she had decorated for clients, this was her best&#x2014;four walls of a panoramic meadow, laced with flowers, tall grasses, sun&#x2013;tipped trees. Everything was white, soft orange, and green, myriad shades of each highlighted with a splotch of blue in a flower or the sky. The feeling was one of a perfect world, gentle, harmonious, and safe.<br><br>Self&#x2013;sufficient she might be, but she had dreamed of a world like this from the moment she had dared to dream again.<br><br>Hugh had grown up in a world like this. His childhood had been sheltered, his adolescence rich. His family had come to America on the Mayflower and been prominent players ever since. Four centuries of success had bred stability. Hugh might downplay the connection, but he was a direct beneficiary of it.<br><br>&#x201c;Your parents expected pastel balloons on the wall,&#x201d; she remarked, releasing his hand. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m afraid I've disappointed them.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not you,&#x201d; he answered, &#x201c;we, but it&#x2019;s a moot point. This isn&#x2019;t my parents&#x2019; baby.&#x201d; He made for the door. &#x201c;I need shoes.&#x201d;<br><br>Moving aside knitting needles that held the top half of a moss green sleepsack, Dana carefully lowered herself into the Boston rocker. She had dragged it down from the attic, where Hugh hid most of his heirloom pieces, and while she had rescued others, now dispersed through the house, this was her favorite. Purchased in the 1840s by his great&#x2013;great&#x2013;grandfather, the eventual Civil War General, it had a spindle back and three&#x2013;section rolled seat that was strikingly comfortable for something so old. Months ago, even before they had put the meadow on the walls, Dana had sanded the rocker&#x2019;s chipped paint and restored it to gleaming perfection. And Hugh had let her. He knew that she valued family history all the more for having lived without it.<br><br>That said, everything else was new, a family history that began here. The crib and its matching dresser were imported, but the rest, from the changing pad on top, to the hand&#x2013;painted fabric framing the windows, to the mural, were custom done by her roster of artists. That roster, which included top&#x2013;notch painters, carpenters, carpet and window people, also included her grandmother and herself. There was a throw over one end of the crib, made by her grandmother and mirroring the meadow mural; a cashmere rabbit that Dana had knitted in every shade of orange; a bunting, two sweaters, numerous hats, and a stack of carriage blankets&#x2014;and that didn&#x2019;t count the winter wool bunting in progress, which was mounded in a wicker basket at the foot of her chair, or the sleepsack she held in her hand. They had definitely gone overboard.<br><br>Rocking slowly, she smiled as she remembered what had been here eight months before. Her pregnancy had just been confirmed, when she had come home from work to find the room blanketed with tulips. Purple, yellow, white&#x2014;all were fresh enough to last for days. Hugh had planned this surprise with sheer pleasure, and Dana believed it had set the tone.<br><br>There was magic in this room. There was warmth and love. There was security. Their baby would be happy here, she knew it would.<br><br>Opening a hand on her stomach, she caressed the mound that was absurdly large in proportion to the rest of her. She couldn&#x2019;t feel the baby move&#x2014;the poor little thing didn&#x2019;t have room to do much more than wiggle a finger or toe&#x2014;but Dana felt the tightening of muscles that would push her child into the world.<br><br>Breathe slowly...Hugh&#x2019;s soothing baritone came back from their Lamaze classes. She was still breathing deeply well after the end of what was definitely another contraction when the slap of flip&#x2013;flops announced his return.<br><br>She grinned. &#x201c;I'm picturing the baby in this room.&#x201d;<br><br>But he was observant to a fault. &#x201c;That was another contraction, wasn&#x2019;t it? Are you timing them?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Not yet. They're too far apart. I&#x2019;m trying to distract myself by thinking happy thoughts. Remember the first time I saw your house?&#x201d;<br><br>It was the right question. Smiling, he leaned against the doorjamb. &#x201c;Sure do. You were wearing neon green.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It wasn&#x2019;t neon, it was lime, and you didn&#x2019;t know what the piece was.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I knew what it was. I just didn&#x2019;t know what it was called.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;It was called a sweater.&#x201d;<br><br>His eyes held hers. &#x201c;Laugh if you want&#x2014;you do every time&#x2014;-but that sweater was more angular and asymmetrical than anything I&#x2019;d ever seen.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Modular.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Modular,&#x201d; he repeated, pushing off from the jamb. &#x201c;Knit in cashmere and silk&#x2014;all of which comes easily to me now, but back then, what did I know?&#x201d; He put both hands on the arms of the rocker and bent down. &#x201c;I interviewed three designers. The others were out of the running the minute you walked in my door. I didn&#x2019;t know about yarn, didn&#x2019;t know about color, didn&#x2019;t know about whether you were any kind of decorator, except that David loved what you did for his house. But we&#x2019;re playing with fire, dear heart. David will kill me if I don&#x2019;t get you to the hospital in time. I&#x2019;m sure he&#x2019;s seen the lights.&#x201d;<br><br>David Johnson lived next door. He was an orthopedic surgeon and divorced. Dana was always trying to set him up, but he always complained, saying that none of the women were her.<br><br>&#x201c;David won&#x2019;t see the lights,&#x201d; she insisted now. &#x201c;He&#x2019;ll be asleep.&#x201d;<br><br>Placing her knitting on the basket, Hugh hoisted her&#x2014;gently&#x2014;to her feet. &#x201c;How do you feel?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Excited. You?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Antsy.&#x201d; He slid an arm around her waist, or thereabouts, but when he saw from her face that another contraction had begun, he said, &#x201c;Definitely less than ten minutes. What, barely five?&#x201d;<br><br>She didn&#x2019;t argue, just concentrated on slowly exhaling until the pain passed. &#x201c;There,&#x201d; she said. &#x201c;Okay&#x2014;boy or girl&#x2014;last chance to guess.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Either one is great, but we can&#x2019;t just hang out here, Dee,&#x201d; he warned. &#x201c;We have to get to the hospital.&#x201d; He tried to steer her toward the hall.<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not ready.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;After nine months?&#x201d;<br><br>Fearful, she put her hand on his chest. &#x201c;What if something goes wrong?&#x201d;<br><br>He grinned and covered her hand. &#x201c;Nothing will go wrong. This is my lucky tee shirt. I&#x2019;ve worn it through every Super Bowl the Patriots have won and through the World Series with the Red Sox.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m serious.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;So am I,&#x201d; he said, all confidence. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve had tests. The baby&#x2019;s healthy. You&#x2019;re healthy. The baby&#x2019;s the perfect birth size. It&#x2019;s in the right position. We have the best obstetrician and the best hospital&#x2014;&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I mean later. What if there&#x2019;s a problem, like when the baby is three? Or seven? Or when it&#x2019;s a teenager, you know, like the problems the Millers have with their son?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;We aren&#x2019;t the Millers.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But it&#x2019;s the big picture, Hugh.&#x201d; She was thinking of the dream she&#x2019;d had prior to waking up. No mystery, that dream. It was about her fear of being found lacking. &#x201c;What if we aren&#x2019;t as good at parenting as we think we&#x2019;ll be?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Now, there&#x2019;s a moot point. A little late to be thinking of it.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Do you realize what we&#x2019;re getting into?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Of course not,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;But we want this baby. Come on, sweetie. We have to leave.&#x201d;<br><br>Dana insisted on returning to the master bath, where she quickly washed her face, rinsed her mouth, and brushed her hair. Turning sideways for a last look, she studied her body&#x2019;s profile. Yes, she preferred being slim&#x2014;yes, she was tired of hauling around thirty extra pounds&#x2014;yes, she was dying to wear jeans and a tee shirt again. But being pregnant was special.<br><br>&#x201c;Dana,&#x201d; Hugh said impatiently. &#x201c;Please.&#x201d;<br><br>She let him guide her down the hall, past the nursery again and toward the stairs. In architectural circles, the house was considered a Newport cottage, though &#x201c;cottage&#x201d; downplayed its grandness. Built in a U that faced the sea, with multiple pairs of French doors opening to a canopied patio, a large swath of soft grass, and a border of beach roses that overlooked the surf, it was a vision of corbels, columns, white trim and shingles gently grayed by the salt air. One wing held the living room, dining room, and library: the other, the kitchen and family room. The master bedroom and nursery were in one wing of the second floor, with two additional bedrooms in the other. The dormered attic housed an office, complete with a balcony. Every room in the house, with the sole exception of the first&#x2013;floor powder room, had a window facing the sea.<br><br>It was Dana&#x2019;s dream house. She had fallen in love with it on sight. More than once, she had told Hugh that even if he had turned into a frog with their first kiss, she would have married him for the house.<br><br>Now, approaching the nearer of two staircases that descended symmetrically to the front hall, she asked, &#x201c;What if it&#x2019;s a girl?&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll love a girl.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;But you want a boy deep down, I know you do, Hugh. It&#x2019;s that family name. You want a little Hugh Ames Clarke.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;d be just as happy with Elizabeth Ames Clarke, as long as I don&#x2019;t have to deliver her myself. Careful here,&#x201d; he said as they started down the stairs, but Dana had to stop at the first turn. The contraction was stronger this time.<br><br>She was prepared for pain, but the fact of it was something else. &#x201c;Can I do this?&#x201d; she asked, shaking noticeably as she clung to his arm.<br><br>He held her more tightly. &#x201c;You? In a minute.&#x201d;<br><br>Hugh had trusted her right from the start. It was one of the things she loved. He hadn&#x2019;t hesitated when she suggested barnboard for the floor of his otherwise modern kitchen or, later, when she insisted that he hang his family portraits&#x2014;large, dark oil paintings of Clarkes with broad brows, square jaws, and straight lips&#x2014;in the living room, though he would have gladly left them packed away in the attic.<br><br>He took his heritage for granted. No, it was more than that. He rebelled against his father&#x2019;s obsession with heritage, said that it embarrassed him.<br><br>Dana must have convinced him that he was a successful figure in his own right, because he had let her hang the oils.

Bibliography and notes. </p> <p> EXTRACT FROM THE CHAPTER ON GOLDSWORTHY&#x2019;S LEAFWORKS </p> <p> It is the leafworks that are the most colourful of Andy Goldsworthy&#x2019;s sculptures. What the leaf sculptures show is how beautiful the colours of nature are: Goldsworthy shows the viewer these subtle colours by contrasting one leaf with another. Maple patch grouped the red/ orange/ yellow of Japanese maple leaves together; Poppy leaves contrasted the red poppy leaves against the mid-green of an elderberry bush; a Stone Wood sculpture of 1992 consisted of poppy leaves wrapped around a hazel branch, the red constrasting vividly with the wet green leaves; Dock Leaves interwove red leaves in green grass stalks. Two sycamore leafworks of 1980 and 1981 are very simple: a leaf black from cow shit is placed against pale Autumn leaves; another leaf, bleached white, is set down on a bed of dark leaves. He pins together two colours of sycamore leaves (sycamore is a favourite Goldsworthy medium) in Sycamore leaf sections (1988), and hangs the line of leaves from a tree. Shot with the sun behind them, the photograph of the leaves shows them glowing green and gold, the two classic colours of poetry and alchemy. The Autumnal colours of course connote nostalgia, decadence, sensuality, Romanticism, time passing, the decay of the year, and so on, all those things John Keats wrote about in his &#x2018;Ode: To Autumn&#x2019;, and in a billion other poets&#x2019; art. Goldsworthy&#x2019;s aim in the leaf pieces, though, draws attention to the fragility and delicacy of leaves, as well as their strength and function. A leaf, after all, is a complex biological factory, so the natural scientists say. &#x2018;There is a whole world in a single leaf&#x2019;, remarked Goldsworthy. Goldsworthy&#x2019;s leafworks do not have a scientific agenda. Rather, they celebrate the presence of leaves, the being-in-the-world of leaves, so to speak. </p> <p> AUTHOR BIOGRAPHY</p> <p> William Malpas has written books on Richard Long and land art, as well as three books on Andy Goldsworthy, including the forthcoming Andy Goldsworthy In America. Malpas&#x2019;s books on Richard Long and Andy Goldsworthy are the only full-length studies of these artists available. </p></p><p>The Art of Andy Goldsworthy discusses all of Goldsworthy&#39;s important and recent exhibitions and books, including the Sheepfolds project; the Channel Four documentary; Wood (1996); and Goldsworthy&#39;s collaboration on a dance performance. This is the most comprehensive and in-depth account of Goldsworthy&#39;s art available. It is a longer and more detailed development of Malpas&#39;s previous, popular book on Goldsworthy&#39;s art.FROM CHAPTER 5 <p>The eroticism of Andy Goldsworthy's sculpture is readily apparent (and one of the reasons for his art's popularity), but the sensuality of Goldsworthy's art is non-human; there are no `human' figures in his work, though there are vaginal openings, phallic rocks, mounds like breasts, cairns bulging outwards like pregnant bellies, and stalks that bend gracefully like ballet dancers: if one wants to anthropomorphize and sexualize Goldsworthy's art, it's easy. Goldsworthy himself anthropomorphizes his work. He says the cones on a hillside are like sentinels or a group of people (Sh, 17). Goldsworthy spoke of stones and seeds in terms of phallic tumescence and orgasmic release: `I found an energy in stone that can best be described as a seed that becomes taut as it ripens - often needing only the slightest of touch to make it explode and scatter its parts' (W, 23). Goldsworthy has made more `traditional' forms of art in galleries: his bracken, fern and horse chestnut stalk works, for instance, were made by pinning the materials onto white gallery walls. These works - Bracken fronds (Ecology Centre, London, 1985), Reeds, bracken and horse chestnut stalks (Centre d'Art Contemporain, Castres, and Galerie Aline Vidal, Paris, 1989) and Reed line drawing (Paris, 1990) - were essentially free, open wall drawings, often employing basic motifs such as the circle and open curve. Hanging screens of plants that Goldsworthy made in galleries include the Susuki grass and Horse chestnut leaf stalks (both made in Japan in 1993), Horse chestnut leaf stalks (1994, Japan), Yucca blades (New Mexico, 2000), and Rushes thorns (1992, San Francisco). Willowherb (1990) was crafted in Goldsworthy's studio.</p></p><h2>Wild Mocktails: Delicious mocktails using home-grown and foraged ingredients</h2><p><b>Create delicious mocktails using home-grown and foraged ingredients.</b><br><br>Award-winning cocktail-maker and gardener Lottie Muir lends her talents to creating a wonderfully wild and varied collection of mocktails, all using home-grown and foraged ingredients, with a focus on low sugar and health conscious recipes.

The adjective &#39;Orwellian&#39; is now a byword for a particular way of thinking about life, literature and language, while Orwell himself has become one of the most potent and symbolic figures in western political thought. Despite this iconic status, Orwell (born Eric Blair) remains an enigma: a passionate democratic socialist steeped in the worst illusions of his Edwardian boyhood, a bitter critic of totalitarianism who concealed a pronounced authoritarian streak, a supporter of social equality who promptly put his adoptive son down for Eton. His progress through the literary world of the 1930s and 40s was characterised by the myths he built around himself. Whether as a reluctant servant of the Raj in 1920s Burma, a mock down-and-out in inter-war England or a Republican volunteer in Spain, he fashioned an image that was often sharply at odds with the real circumstances of his life. Drawing on a mass of previously unseen material, including interviews with friends and people who knew him in his years of obscurity, D. J. Taylor offers a strikingly human portrait of the writer too often embalmed as a secular saint. Here is a man who, for all his outward unworldliness, effectively stage-managed his own life; who combined chilling detachment with warmth and gentleness, disillusionment with hope; who battled through illness to produce two of the greatest masterpieces of the twentieth century. Moving and revealing, Taylor&#39;s &#34;Orwell&#34; is the biography we have all been waiting for, as vibrant, powerful and resonant as its extraordinary hero.</p><p>D.J. Taylor was born in Norwich in 1960. He is a novelist, critic and acclaimed biographer, whose Orwell: The Life won the Whitbread Biography prize in 2003. His most recent books are Kept: A Victorian Mystery (a Publishers Weekly Book of the Year), Bright Young People: The Rise and Fall of a Generation 1918-1940, and the novels Ask Alice, At the Chime of a City Clock and Derby Day.George Orwell (1903-1950), ne Eric Blair, seemed only a marginal Depression-era writer about disillusion and hopelessness among ordinary working types until the Spanish Civil War, when in 1937 he was shot through the neck and nearly killed, furnishing him with the lens to see totalitarianism and betrayal as, possibly, the future human condition. In his now classic Homage to Catalonia, then a commercial failure, he wrote of papers reporting facts that were lies, patriotism that was propaganda, loyalty that was treachery, heroism that was cowardice. The results, in a bleak career abbreviated at 46 by unremitting tuberculosis, emerged in the dystopian fable Animal Farm and in the mean urban wasteland of 1984, in which history is rewritten daily, and obedience is the only recourse for the brainwashed powerless. Taylor, author of an earlier biography of Thackeray, limns Orwell's life graphically, and relates his early fiction and journalism persuasively to the iconic postwar novels, describing his writing as "an endless scroll constantly refined and brought up to date, in which early entries reemerge to assume an expected resonance." Tendencies to cliche disappear as Taylor warms up to his theme of an Etonian displaced in a remorseless world. A few brief chapters seem merely stuck in, but Orwell's essentially lonely and downstart life, and his triumphs almost too late to matter, make for compelling reading. 16 pages of b&amp;w illus. not seen by PW. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Gone to New York: Adventures in the City</h2><p><p>Welcome to Ian Frazier's New York, where every block is an event, and where the denizens are larger than life.

A frequent contributor to <i>The New Yorker</i>, he lives in Montclair, New Jersey.</p><b>ANTIPODES</b><b></b><br><br>If you drilled a hole straight through the earth, starting at the corner of Seventh Avenue and Forty-second Street, you would pass through ten inches of pavement, four feet of pipes, thirty-five feet of Seventh Avenue subway, about twenty-two hundred miles of rock, about thirty-six hundred miles of nickel-iron core, and then another twenty-two hundred miles of rock. You would come out in the Indian Ocean, 106�3' east longitude and 40�45' south latitude, about three hundred miles off the southwest coast of Australia. You would have reached Manhattan&#x2019;s antipodes, or diametrically opposite point on the globe. You would be about two and a half miles under water.<br><br>Due north of Manhattan&#x2019;s antipodes, it is 2,040 miles to Malingping, Java. Due south, it is 1,500 miles to the Knox Coast of Antarctica, 2,260 miles to the Russian research station at Vostok, Antarctica, and 2,955 miles to the South Pole. Due west, it is 7,700 miles to Punta Rasa (Flat Point), Argentina. Due east, it is 1,760 miles to Cape Grim, Tasmania. The town nearest to Manhattan&#x2019;s antipodes is Augusta, Australia, 590 miles to the northeast, where Australians go for fishing vacations and where it rains about half the year.<br><br>Not much goes on in this part of the Indian Ocean. It is fall there now. The water is gray-green, like the North Atlantic, and very rough. Navigators call these latitudes &#x201c;the roaring forties,&#x201d; because the storms are so violent. There are no shipping lanes near Manhattan&#x2019;s antipodes, so there is no junk on the ocean floor. The ocean floor is completely dark (except for the light produced by occasional luminescent fish and other organisms), and the water at the bottom is only a few degrees above freezing. A white, squishy substance known as globigerina ooze covers the ocean floor. Glob ooze, as oceanographers call it, is a calcium sediment made of the shells of globigerina, which are tiny foraminiferal organisms. Glob ooze can be anywhere from less than an inch to a thousand feet thick. Since it is too much trouble to wash the salt out of it even to make cement, glob ooze has no commercial value. This far from land, there are few fish. A school of whales might pass by seasonally. There might be a few rattails (bottom-feeders related to the shark family) near the ocean floor.<br><br>If you could walk northeast to Australia, wearing some kind of glob-ooze shoes to keep from sinking in, as well as equipment to deal with the problems of air, light, temperature, and water pressure, you would have to cross underwater mountains of sixty-four hundred feet and descend nineteen thousand feet into valleys before you ascended Australia&#x2019;s continental slope, nearly four hundred miles away. Manhattan&#x2019;s antipodes lies on the southeastern branch of the Mid-Indian Oceanic Ridge, which is a Y-shaped ridge in the middle of the Indian Ocean with heights of ten thousand feet and valleys as deep as fourteen thousand feet. The Mid-Oceanic Ridge is the longest continuous feature on the earth&#x2019;s surface. Dr. Bruce Heezen, of Columbia&#x2019;s Lamont-Doherty Geological Observatory (one of the few New Yorkers who have ever been close to Manhattan&#x2019;s antipodes), made the first detailed map of the Indian Ocean floor, under the auspices of the International Indian Ocean Expedition, in the early 1960s. He says that the discovery and exploration of the Mid-Oceanic Ridge provided the conclusive proof for the theory of continental drift. &#x201c;About fifty million years ago, the ridge moved through Antarctica and chipped off a huge piece&#x2014;Australia&#x2014;which then headed north and rotated slightly counterclockwise until it crashed into Indonesia,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;It did not take long, in geological time. When we discovered that ridge, and when we found that the central and eastern Indian Ocean was much younger than the western Indian Ocean, the theory of continental drift was finally accepted. Before this discovery, if you believed in drift you couldn&#x2019;t get a job. Now if you don&#x2019;t you can&#x2019;t.&#x201d;<br><br>About the biggest thing that has ever happened near Manhattan&#x2019;s antipodes happened three hundred miles away, in the course of the International Indian Ocean Expedition. A British member of Parliament, on board the Australian ship <i>Diamantina</i>, was mapping the ocean floor with an echo sounder that was faulty&#x2014;something he did not realize. About three hundred miles southwest of Australia, he and his shipmates started getting some extremely deep soundings. They became very excited about this and later claimed to the press that they had found the deepest point in the oceans. They named their find the Diamantina Trench. When their claim was investigated, it turned out to be wrong.

The author's woodsy backyard at the base of the Oakland hills becomes a laboratory for encounters with a variety of animals, from deer, raccoons and squirrels to birds, lizards and feral cats. The more Moses learns about their natural histories, the more curious she becomes about their life histories--their stories. After a failed attempt at backyard farming, Moses turns her energies to wildlife gardening in an effort to restore some of the dwindling habitat that sustains our wild neighbors. A captivating blend of memoir, natural history and storytelling, illustrated with original linoleum block prints by Dave Buchen, <i>Zooburbia</i> is a magnifying lens turned to our everyday environment.</p><p>Tai Moses has been a journalist and editor for many years. She has also worked as a veterinary assistant, a barista, a hotel maid, and a wildlands firefighter. Formerly a senior editor at AlterNet.org, her writing has been widely published in the independent press. Tai lives in Santa Cruz, CA, with her husband, her dog Arrow, and a number of cats.How to Have Confidence <br> <br>"It is easy to conquer the world from the back of a horse." � <i>Genghis Khan</i> <br> <br>I knew a woman who kept Icelandic horses, and one Saturday she invited me along on a group ride. We started at Waddell Creek, off Pacific Coast Highway, and rode through the giant redwoods and lush meadows of Big Basin State Park. I was riding a chestnut mare with a flaxen mane and tail whose name was Lutka, which is Icelandic for luck. It had rained earlier in the day and the skies were clearing in the lowlands, but the forest was bathed in fog so thick we couldn't see from one end of the trail to the other. It was misty and cool, and the horses were in high spirits. All of these horses had been born in Iceland and brought to the States. Perhaps the weather made them think they were back on their windy coastal island. <br> <br>We rode through the dripping rainforest, passing trees furred with bright green moss, slick ferns unfurling delicate new fronds, black and orange caterpillars dozing on branches. We practiced t�lting, the smooth fifth gait of Icelandic horses. In the afternoon we jumped over a fallen log, and one rider fell off her horse. The riderless horse bolted, and since Lutka and I were closest we gave chase, pursuing the runaway down the twisting trail until we were galloping side by side. I leaned out over my horse and grabbed the runaway horse&#x2019;s reins, at a full gallop, like a trick rider, and gradually the two horses slowed to a trot, and finally a walk. We turned around and trotted back to join the other horses. All the riders applauded when they saw us, and when Lutka heard the applause she snorted and pranced sideways down the trail. She knew we were heroes. That was a great day. <br> <br>I didn't realize it was one of my dreams to be a trick rider until quite late in life, when it was impossible, in a practical sense, to fulfill the dream. But I took pleasure in the knowledge anyway. I knew, in the way you just know some things, that if I had realized earlier in life that I wanted to be a trick rider I could have been one, and somehow, that was enough. Why did I not become a trick rider? Who cares? The reasons we haven't done the things we have't done are not that interesting. In Mongolia, where horses are cherished and children are put in the saddle from a young age, the measure of a gifted rider is someone who can pick coins off the ground at a full gallop. I've never had a chance to do that, but I think I could. In fact, I know I could, and somehow, that's enough. <br> <br>Whenever my self-confidence is at a low ebb, I remember Lutka and our wild gallop through the forest. I remember that feeling of triumph when I reached for the runaway horse's reins and grabbed them on the first try. I remember the feeling of being perfectly poised in the saddle, as if Lutka and I were a single being, fused together. I think, <i>I can do anything.</i> And I know it's true. <br></p><h2>Chick: His Unpublished Memoirs and the Memories of Those Who Knew Him</h2><p><p>Chick Hearn was the beloved broadcaster for the Los Angeles Lakers for four decades and 3,338 consecutive games; his previously unpublished memoirs are now available for the first time, along with a anecdotes and stories from those who knew him&#x2014;and the Lakers&#x2014;best. Also included is an audio CD that features Chick's greatest calls.</p></p><p>Slam dunk. Air ball. Dribble drive. Ticky-tack foul. <p>All are integral elements to anyone's basketball vernacular, and all were coined by legendary broadcaster Chick Hearn. But Chick's contributions to the game of basketball, to the Los Angeles Lakers organization, and to fans in particular, go light years beyond popularizing a dozen or so of the catch-phrases so widely used today. </p><p>Chick Hearn ws the voice of the Lakers basketball from the day the franchise moved from Minneapolis to Los Angeles in 1960. He himself had migrated from the Midwest, taking his wife Mrage, son, Gary, and daughter, Samantha, while leaving behind a devoted following in Peoria, Illinois. What he created in L.A., however, became more like an extended family several million listeners and views strong. </p><p>After signing on to become the first Los Angeles Lakers play-by-play announcer, Chick worked tirelessly to build his legend. He prepared fanatically for games; he bonded with players, coaches, and management; he reviewed every broadcast in search of ways to improve; and, ultimately, he all but perfected his craft. He broadcast an astounding 3,338 consecutive games during his 42-year career, and his name rings louder among Laker fans and family than the likes of Baylor, West, or even Johnson. </p><p>To those players he was a father figure, developing deep friendships and helping them find their way in the unpredictable world of professional basketball. To the coaches he was an ally, earning their confidence and respect with his uncanny knowledge of the game and providing valuable insight from his unique "world-eye view". To colleagues in the media he became larger than life, but never too big to offer words of encouragement or to lend a helping hand. </p><p>His greatest prescenece of all, though, was with the fans. He bridged the team and the organization to the millions of faithful, fanatical followers of the purple and gold. Chick lived and breathed Lakers basketball, and he delivered it to the Southern California living room with a passion only he could muster. He was part of the family, to be sure, but he was also fair and objective and called every game the way it was played. </p><p>Chick lived and worked through every incarnation that has been the Los Angeles Lakers, a team that is now considered by many to be the most visible and perennially charismatic franchise in sports. The struggles of the sixties and the losses to Russell's Celtics; the triumphs of Elgin Baylor and Jerry West; the passing of the torch from Wilt to Kareem; and the separate dynasties of Magic and now Shaq and Kobe - Chick was the only common denominator tied to the organization during that incredible five-decade span. </p><p>Chick includes Hearn's own take on that remarkable relationship and his untold stories about the players, coaches, and owners that have contributed to the Lakers' fascinating history. It also includes their stories about Chick, offering rate glimpses into the mind of a broadcasting legend and a devoted and emotional family man who endured more personal loss than many of us could ever imagine.</p><p><b>Chick Hearn</b> was an American sportscaster known primarily as the long-time play-by-play announcer for the Los Angeles. <b>Steve Springer</b> is the author of multiple books, including the <i>New York Times</i> bestseller <i>American Son: The Oscar De La Hoya Story</i>.

Paul Getty Museum)</h2><p>With its fittingly dramatic design, <em>Courbet and the Modern Landscape</em> accompanies the first major museum exhibition specifically to address Gustave Courbet's extraordinary achievement in landscape painting. Many of these carefully selected works produced from 1855 to 1876--gathered from Asia, Europe, and North America--will be new to readers.<br> The catalogue--which accompanies an exhibition at the Getty Museum to be held from February 21 to May 14, 2006--highlights the artist's expressive responses to the natural environment. Essays by the curators examine Courbet's distinctly modern practice of landscape painting. Mary Morton's essay situates his landscapes in relation to his work in other genres, his critical reputation, and his role in establishing a new pictorial language for landscape painting. Charlotte Eyerman's essay investigates how later generations of nineteenth- and twentieth-century artists responded to Courbet's example. The catalogue also includes an essay by Dominique de Font-R�aulx, curator of photographs at the Mus�e d'Orsay, on the relationship between Courbet's work and landscape photography of the 1850s and 1860s.</p><p><br><strong>Mary Morton</strong> is associate curator, and <strong>Charlotte Eyerman</strong> is assistant curator in the Department of Paintings at the Getty Museum.<br></p><h2>Charles the Bold: The Last Valois Duke of Burgundy (History of Valois Burgundy)</h2><p>Charles the Bold (1467-1477) was the last of the great Dukes of Burgundy. This historical and biographical work assesses his personality and his role as a ruler, and discusses his relationship with his subjects and his neighbours.

Baron&#x2019;s Study of the Lute (Untersuchung des Instruments der Lauten) published in 1727, is one of the most comprehensive and important lute treatises in the 300 year history of the instrument. It contains much information that is unique to it, and deals with subjects that can be found in no other source. It is a mine of information concerning the history of the instrument, lute makers, composers, players, technique and performance practices of the day. At last, this work has been translated into delightful English by Douglas A. Smith, retaining much of the flamboyant flavor of the original. A long preface gives the background of the work, its era, and the life of Baron. The present edition improves the value of the original, since explanatory footnotes, appendices, and an index have been added. Also, the voluminous Latin and Greek passages have been translated.

While urging planners not to use these general categories as simplistic pigeonholes, the authors show that the identifying distinctive styles of social interaction can guide church planters toward openness in a community. Charts and study data help explain class structures and social characteristics. Particular attention is paid to city-dwellers since much evangelism now targets this group. For each societal setting planners receive important information about moral norms and potential social problems to expect as they carry out their ministries.The late <b>Paul G.

Colonel, U.S. Representative, &#x201c;Dad,&#x201d; and Scourge of the Far Left. He rose from humble beginnings in Atlanta where his father instilled in him a code of conduct that would inform his life ever after.&nbsp; Throughout his years leading troops, raising a loving family, serving as Congressman in Florida&#x2019;s 22nd district, and emerging as one of the most authentic voices in conservative politics, West has never compromised the core values on which he was raised: family, faith, tradition, service, honor, fiscal responsibility, courage, freedom.<br>&nbsp;<br>Today, these values are under attack as never before, and as the far Left intensifies its assaults, few have been as vigorous as West in pushing back.&nbsp; He refuses to let up, calling out an Obama administration that cares more about big government than following the Constitution, so-called black &#x201c;leaders&#x201d; who sell out their communities in exchange for pats on the head, and a segment of the media that sees vocal black conservatives as threats to be silenced.<br>&nbsp;<br>Now more than ever, the American republic needs a guardian: a principled, informed conservative who understands where we came from, who can trace the philosophical roots of our faith and freedom, and who has a plan to get America back on track. West isn&#x2019;t afraid to speak truth to power, and in this book he&#x2019;ll share the experiences that shaped him and the beliefs he would die to defend.</p><p><b>ALLEN WEST</b> was born and raised in Atlanta, Georgia--in the same neighborhood where Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. once preached. He is the third of four generations of military members in his family. During his twenty-two year Army career he commanded troops and deployed to several combat zones.

This is my first visit to the Cayman Islands, and I will certainly return at some point to dive the famous reef walls.<br><br>But my purpose for this trip is to attend the Young Caymanian Leadership Awards gala this evening as keynote speaker. It's an amazing journey that has brought me to this place on this day. From the far reaches of Iraq during Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm, to the forbidding terrain of Afghanistan during the early 2000s, to the storied halls of our nation's capitol in 2011, to this moment in a fancy hotel in the Caribbean--I never could have imagined leading such a life given my simple origins in the inner city of Atlanta.<br><br>I was born in February 1961. It was a very different America then. Segregation was widely practiced and hotly debated. The possibility of a black president was unimaginable. That summer, a little over six hundred miles south of my hometown, on a beach in Fort Lauderdale, Florida, there was a protest called the "wade-in." A group of civil rights activists joined hands and waded into the whites-only beach off Las Olas Boulevard to protest segregation.<br><br>But times do change. Fifty years later, in January 2011, I was sworn in as the United States representative for that very same beach in Florida's Twenty-Second Congressional District.<br><br>When considered together, these two seemingly unrelated events--a wade-in and a man pledging the oath of office--testify to the exceptionalism of our republic the same type of exceptionalism that my parents instilled in me from a young age.<br><br>When I was growing up, my mother taught me a simple maxim: "A man must stand for something or he will fall for anything." That sentiment may well have guided a young man born a bastard on the island of Nevis in the British West Indies not far from Grand Cayman, where I am writing this book today. Somehow this young man made it to a place where he could seek his own destiny. He fought in the Continental Army for the independence of a fledgling country soon to be called the United States. He became a member of the Continental Congress. He was a cowriter of what must be considered the greatest political document ever written, the Constitution of the United States. Ultimately he became the first secretary of the treasury of America. His name was Alexander Hamilton.<br><br>America is indeed a great land of dreams and opportunity. This fact is as true today as it was in the time of Alexander Hamilton.<br><br>In my case, my opportunity--and indeed my destiny--was to uphold this republic, first by serving in the military and then by serving in government. As an American ronin, I hold steadfast to my beliefs, no matter what challenges or obstacles arise in my path. In 2012 I sought reelection to the US House of Representatives in the newly drawn Eighteenth Congressional District in southeastern Florida. To say the campaign was hotly contested would be a gross understatement. I remember being in the city of Port Saint Lucie at an early-voting site when a black woman came up to me. She asked if I was Allen West. I don't know how she could have been unsure about that, but in any event, I knew from her tone of voice what was about to follow--and she didn't let me down.<br><br>As my fellow black American looked at me, her face began to distort and she screamed, "How could you do this? How could you be one of them? Your parents are ashamed of you. You are not a real black person." My response? Just a smile, a simple smile, because this woman was forgetting completely the best aspect of America: free will. Obviously she didn't understand that I am, and continue to be, exactly what my parents raised me to be. As Solomon said in the book of Proverbs, "train up a child in the way he should go"--in other words, our lives are shaped by our early lessons, and I was fortunate to have parents who taught me to exercise freedom of thought.<br><br>I was the middle son of Herman and Elizabeth Thomas West. My parents were affectionately nicknamed Buck and Snooks, and for the sake of this book, that's how I will refer to them from now on--even though they would've whupped me silly if they ever heard me call them that.<br><br>I never knew my grandmothers. They both passed before I was born. My granddads were Jule Wynn on my father's side and Samuel Thomas on my mother's, and both were rocks of men. My grandfathers had soft-spoken demeanors, but they commanded respect and admiration for their comportment and wisdom. As a child I loved going down south to Cuthbert, Georgia, to visit Granddad Jule. Granddad Sam lived over in southeast Atlanta. You could see Lakewood Stadium and the fairgrounds from his backyard. I also spent lots of time visiting my Aunt Madear down in Camilla, Georgia. From these wise men and women, I learned to cultivate the cornerstone of character: respect. Often I would simply sit and listen to them tell their stories, but they also demanded that I talk to them and tell them about my life. Nowadays children are allowed to stay absorbed in their keypads and headphones, but I was taught at an early age how to communicate, listen respectfully, and appreciate the insights of my elders.<br><br>They'd take me fishing or out to pick pecans (properly pronounced in southern vernacular as PEE-cans) or peaches (to this day I don't like peaches because of the incessant itching caused by peach fuzz). Sometimes they'd have me walk with them to local stores and make me carry the bags--a practice that today is sadly considered "old school."<br><br>Madear and both granddads have gone on, but I will never forget Granddad Jule's description of me as a young kid. He told my father, "Buck, that boy Allen of yours is as stubborn as a mule sometimes, but he is a good boy."<br><br>My dad, Buck West, was born in 1920 in Ozark, Alabama, but he somehow managed to jump the Chattahoochee River over to Georgia, where he grew up. Dad stood about five feet eleven inches and wore a flattop high and tight--which is why I wear the same haircut to this day. Buck was a soft-spoken but direct man, loved by all with whom he came in contact. His word was his bond, and you could always count on him. Dad served in World War II as a logistics specialist. I was enraptured by his stories of North Africa during a time of war, of the Anzio beach landing in Italy, and of the time he went to Rome and saw the Vatican.<br><br>Dad was wounded in Italy during a Nazi bombardment. He had been running dispatches on a motorcycle (now you know why I ride). He experienced severe head trauma and remained in a coma for a spell. I'll never forget the first time he allowed me to touch the bumps left on his head.<br><br>Dad came back to America and met and married his first wife. They had my older brother, Herman West Jr., whom we all knew by the nickname "Pootney." Unfortunately Dad's first wife passed away, but he eventually met my mom. Rumor has it they were really good dancers--but I can assure you that's one area where I don't take after Buck West! Dad worked as an insurance agent for a time but eventually, after marrying my mom, got a job with the Veterans Administration hospital in Atlanta.<br><br>My mother, Snooks West, was born in 1931 in south Georgia. I'm unclear about the geographic particulars--she was born in the vicinity of Fort Valley and Perry, but she spent time growing up around Camilla. For me, Fort Valley was her home and where the folks on my mother's side lived.<br><br>Both my parents had relatives in the Albany-Camilla-Thomasville area of Georgia. As a young kid, I thought my mom's family had founded Thomasville, since Thomas was her maiden name. Mom went to Fort Valley State College and was a public school teacher for quite some time. As it happens, my high school girlfriend's mother had been taught by my mother (and yeah, that made for some awkward moments).<br><br>Mom and Dad moved to Atlanta sometime around 1959 and found a home in the historic Fourth Ward. They bought a nice two-story house at 651 Kennesaw Avenue Northeast, a small street between Ponce de Leon Avenue and North Avenue. The house is still there, and whenever I'm in Atlanta, I go by and relive memories. My mom's younger brother and sister, Uncle Sam and Aunt Brendalyn, also lived in our house and were like older siblings to me.<br><br>Our small street was a little oasis of families, two-parent homes, kids, and a real sense of community. In those days the treat for us youngsters was playing street ball while the old men sat by the sidewalk, told stories, and watched over us, warning us of oncoming cars. As we grew older, we would go to friends' houses to watch the old men play checkers. If you want excitement, watch a group of older gents compete at checkers like we did. I truly believe that their banter was the genesis of trash talking.<br><br>Our neighborhood included the Heards, Jacksons, Rowes, Martins, Davenports, Littles, and Washingtons. While the men played checkers, the women would sit out on the porches and talk. There were times when the old men would let one of us young ones step up to the checkers table. They knew it wouldn't take long to smash us, and it didn't. Most times I remember them spanking us in about four moves. Bam! And it was over. Then, of course, came the trash talking to our dads about not teaching us to play--but at least teaching us how to take a whipping.<br><br>Back then there was no hiring folks to cut your grass or wash the car. We young fellas developed a sense of business by competing against each other for grass-cutting and car-washing jobs. I learned about pricing and providing services in the free market at an early age. You could cut grass, but then someone would undercut you by offering lawn edging. You could wash a car, but someone would also offer to sweep the inside and give the interior a good leather shine. Success was about competing for and getting the job and then doing it so well that you were the one in demand. My angle was to tackle the big jobs, such as the backyards where the kudzu vines grew. And that's how I spent my Saturdays growing up--grass cutting and car washing.<br><br>On Sunday there was only one place you were going to be, and that was church. Several churches stood proudly all along "our" Boulevard. My family's church was Fort Street United Methodist Church, where I also attended Sunday school. Every Sunday the nine a.m. parade of residents would leave from our little street, cross North Avenue, and head over to Boulevard, where we'd stop off at our respective houses of worship.<br><br>Church was where you made your other group of friends, especially for me, because many people in our congregation came from all across the Atlanta area. Only severe sickness could get you out of church. Even if you were visiting extended family elsewhere, you were not going to miss Sunday services. When I stayed with relatives down in south Georgia, I was certainly going to church--no way was I going to embarrass my mom and dad by not attending.<br><br>But it wasn't just the weekly sermons and Sunday school lessons that taught me the fundamental principles of faith. I remember the ol' "Mothers of the Church." Trust me, in church everyone was your mother--in fact these ladies were allowed to smack you. The elders of the church were my surrogate dads. Disrespecting them at times could be worse than disrespecting my own father.<br><br>Back in the old-school way, a child was an extension of the parents. The child reflected the parents and their parenting skills, and you as the child were their calling card. I remember being down in Cuthbert and going out somewhere. When I was walking back to my granddad's, I didn't speak to any of the folks sitting out on the front porches. I had no sooner hit Granddad's first step when my dad greeted me with a whack. It had already gotten back to him that his boy Allen was disrespectful and did not properly greet his elders.<br><br>Buck was a quiet man, and I learned never to have a negative effect on his impeccable reputation, especially in his hometown. You can bet from that moment on, I learned to say good morning, good day, good afternoon, good evening, sir, ma'am--and that lesson resonates with me today. In fact, it's a courtesy I demand my own daughters practice.<br><br>Mom was the real disciplinarian in our home. I saw Snooks West as a benevolent dictator, and I mean she was tough. Mom was an old-school southern woman with a soft, sweet voice and dialect. She stood around five feet six inches but had a demeanor that made her seem six feet tall. She was the standard-bearer, and she demanded excellence. Dad and Mom had separate bedrooms, but they loved each other. It was just that Mom, as the ultimate independent woman, wanted her space. Truth be told, Mom was a tad bit, well, messy. But she was a first-class woman and loved to dress, and it's no surprise that her closet was always overflowing.<br><br>Mom was thrifty, however, and she never believed in owing anyone. Her favorite place to shop was Sears, Roebuck, which was right down the street on Ponce de Leon. Remember layaway? That was Mom's preferred means to get something she wanted. And she was not about to overspend. Instead she would set the money aside, little by little.<br><br>When Mom went to get herself a new car, she paid in cash. She would go to the dealership and find what she wanted. When the sales guy asked about payment plans, Mom would softly say, "How much is the price, child?" and proceed to write a check.<br><br>My dad was equally thrifty. I found it hard to believe how incredibly savvy my mom and dad were with finances. They were careful investors and could make a dollar stretch like you cannot imagine. If they were on Capitol Hill today, our federal budget would be balanced easily.</p><h2>I, etcetera: Stories</h2><p>These eight stories about distinctly modern ordeals show Sontag&#39;s restless, vital imagination at its most adventurous and compelling.</p><p>"These short stories...establish Sontag's originality in story, her unique vision, her success with experiments in form." --<i>Los Angeles Times</i><br><br>"A fine collection." --<i>Houston Post</i><br><br>"Sontag travels our heartland and writes of it in a telling, shorthand way that is as unusual as it is trenchant." --<i>Publishers Weekly</i><br><br>"All of the eight stories in Susan Sontag's first collection ... are worth reading or reading again.

She lives in Brooklyn.***This excerpt is from an advance uncorrected copy proof*** <br><br>Copyright � 2018 Louisa Luna<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie Brandt was not a bad mother. Later she would tell that to anyone who would listen: police, reporters, lawyers, her parents, her boyfriend, her dealer, the new bartender with the knuckle tattoos at Schultz&#x2019;s, the investigator from California and her partner, and her own reflection in the bathroom mirror, right before cracking her forehead on the sink&#x2019;s edge and passing out from the cocktail of pain, grief, and fear.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She was not a bad mother, even though she&#x2019;d yelled at them that morning. It was Saturday, finally, and Jamie was embarrassed to say sometimes she liked the weekdays more, the predictable rhythm of her aunt Maggie&#x2019;s real estate office where she was the receptionist, the chance to drink coffee and read <i>Us </i>magazine online, thinking of the girls in school, which they actually liked for the most part. Kylie, the ten-year-old, might piss and moan over homework, but she loved the day-to-day operations of school&#x2014;the hurricane of note passing and gossip. She was already popular, had already stolen makeup from Jamie&#x2019;s top dresser drawer and sent texts to boys from Jamie&#x2019;s phone. Bailey, eight, was just as sassy but loved school for the school part, read�ing and writing&#x2014;especially vocabulary, the way words sounded and the rules that went with them.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The weekends were hectic, a blur of soccer games and ballet prac�tice, playdates and every last minute crammed with errands: grocer�ies, cooking, pharmacy (Kylie&#x2019;s allergies, Bailey&#x2019;s asthma), cleaning the apartment, dusting and Swiffering every surface to avoid allergies and asthma. And then meltdowns and screaming protests about the rules: one hour on the computer for non-school-related activities, half an hour of video games, one hour of TV, all of which would be broken by Sunday night. Jamie would have to beg them to go to the housing com�plex playground, which the girls claimed was old, dirty, with two out of five swings broken and a sandbox that smelled like pee.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;All Jamie wanted was to get to Saturday night. Then Darrell would come over and maybe the girls would go somewhere for a sleepover, or to Nana and Papa&#x2019;s. Maybe Jamie would let them play video games for a bonus hour in their room and take pictures with her phone just so she and Darrell could drink some beers and watch a movie that didn&#x2019;t feature a chipmunk or a princess. And if the girls weren&#x2019;t there, maybe they&#x2019;d smoke a joint; maybe his hand would slide up her shirt and they&#x2019;d end up naked on the couch, Jamie looking at him on top, thinking he is not perfect, he has funny teeth and always wears that leather jacket with the hole in the pit, but there are a few good qualities here. One large good quality: she would think and then she&#x2019;d laugh, and Darrell would say, &#x201c;What?&#x201d; but then he&#x2019;d laugh too.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;But first, errands and then a birthday party for all of them. It was for a girl in Kylie&#x2019;s class, but it was one of those parties to which every�one was invited&#x2014;siblings and parents for pizza, games, and cake in the family&#x2019;s big ranch-style house in a new development called The Knolls. Jamie didn&#x2019;t like the trend, these big free-for-all events, was worried because Kylie&#x2019;s birthday was in June and maybe she&#x2019;d want the same thing. Jamie saw the problems coming at her like headlights: their apartment was too small for a party, her mother would never let her hear the end of it if she asked to have it at her parents&#x2019; place, and the money, all that money, for that many pizzas plus gifts plus a new dress for Kylie and the new dress Bailey would have to have too.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Why do you guys even have to come in?&#x201d; said Kylie from the pas�senger side, eyebrows wrinkled up over her big hot-cocoa eyes, a sneer in her angel lips.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Fine, we&#x2019;ll wait outside in the car,&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Everyone will see us,&#x201d; said Bailey from the backseat, anxious.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie looked in the rearview, taking in Bailey&#x2019;s face, a palette of worry. How can she care so much about what other people think already? thought Jamie. She didn&#x2019;t want the girls to care; she missed the days when they were too little to worry about appearances or be embarrassed, back when they would streak like hippies before jumping into the tub.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We&#x2019;re not waiting in the car, Kylie,&#x201d; said Jamie. &#x201c;Hey&#x2014;won&#x2019;t Stella Piper be there with her family? Bailey can play with Owen.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;From the corner of her eye Jamie saw her shrug, and felt the weight of it.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not friends anymore,&#x201d; said Bailey.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;They&#x2019;re not?&#x201d; Jamie said to Bailey. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re not?&#x201d; she said to Kylie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Why can&#x2019;t you shut up?&#x201d; Kylie said, craning her head around the seat to glare at her sister.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Mom!&#x201d; shouted Bailey, pointing.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I heard it, Bailey.&#x201d; To Kylie: &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk like that to your sister. Why aren&#x2019;t you friends with Stella Piper anymore?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Another shrug.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;She thinks Stella&#x2019;s dumb. And her glasses are funny,&#x201d; Bailey reported. &#x201c;She says they make her look like a creature.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;She&#x2019;s been your friend forever, since you were in kindergarten,&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I know,&#x201d; said Kylie, hushed and hissing.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie stopped third in a trail of cars at a light and said, &#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t be mean to someone just because they look funny.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kylie stared out the window.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Someday someone might think you look funny, and then how&#x2019;ll you like it?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kylie kept staring.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Well?&#x201d; Jamie took Kylie&#x2019;s chin in her hand and turned her head. &#x201c;Well?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I won&#x2019;t like it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie let go and looked up to see a policeman directing all the cars in her lane to the left.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What&#x2019;s this now?&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Bailey looked up over the seat.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What is it? What&#x2019;s happening?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t know, for God&#x2019;s sake,&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She pulled up even with the cop and rolled down the window.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I need to go straight ahead to the Gulf on Branford.&#x201d; <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Branford? That side of the highway&#x2019;s closed for the parade, Miss,&#x201d; said the cop.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Fuck me,&#x201d; Jamie said, remembering.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Spring Fest. The town&#x2019;s annual parade of toilet-paper-covered floats and high school bands slogging their way through &#x201c;My Girl.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Mom!&#x201d; the kids shouted, embarrassed.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Well, Officer, I&#x2019;m about to run outta gas, so what do you recommend?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The cop leaned into her window.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Tell you what, I&#x2019;ll wave you through to St. Cloud; then you can take a right to Route 1080 and you can get to the Hess over that way.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie pictured the route in her head and nodded. &#x201c;That&#x2019;d be just great, thanks.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No problem, ma&#x2019;am,&#x201d; said the cop, tapping the roof of the car.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie drove the path laid out for her by the cop.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I can&#x2019;t believe you said the f-curse to the police,&#x201d; said Kylie, a look of quiet shame on her face.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m full of surprises,&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Can we go past the parade? Miss Ferno&#x2019;s on a float from her church,&#x201d; said Bailey.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What? No, we&#x2019;re already late for this thing,&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She glanced at both of them. They stared out the window. Someday you&#x2019;ll think I&#x2019;m funny, she thought. Someday you&#x2019;ll tell your friends, No, my mom&#x2019;s cool. Once she said &#x201c;Fuck me&#x201d; right in front of a cop.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Finally, when they got to the Hess, Kylie asked, &#x201c;Can we split a Reese&#x2019;s?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She had yet to outgrow an unwavering devotion to sugar&#x2014;she would pour maple syrup over Frosted Flakes if you turned your head the other way.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No, you&#x2019;re going to have all kinds of crap at this party; you don&#x2019;t need a Reese&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Then the wailing began&#x2014;you&#x2019;d think someone was pricking their cuticles with sewing needles. Jamie held her head and leaned over the wheel, thinking she should have smoked the very last bit of resin in the pipe this morning. She didn&#x2019;t like to drive stoned, but there wasn&#x2019;t enough in there to mess her up proper, just enough to help her push through, get to the party where it might be acceptable to have a light beer at noon. <br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Enough, stop it!&#x201d; yelled Jamie, feeling her voice crack, the muscles in her neck tense up. &#x201c;Fine, go get a goddamn Reese&#x2019;s. Get me a coffee with a Splenda, please.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She threw a five in Kylie&#x2019;s lap.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Go before I change my mind,&#x201d; she said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The girls unbuckled their seat belts and scrambled out of the car. Jamie watched them run into the mini-mart, heard the clicks of their dress-up shoes. She checked her makeup in the mirror and shook her head at herself, then went out to the pumps.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She continued to shake her head, thought, Jesus Christ, do I ever sound like her&#x2014;her own mother, Gail&#x2014;&#x201c;Before I change my mind&#x201d; and all those threats. First you swear you&#x2019;ll never be like your mother; then you find yourself sending them to their room and grounding them, and occasionally, once in a while, you hit them once or twice too hard on the back after they say something rude.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie got back in the car and blew air into her hands. Spring Fest my ass, she thought. It was the end of March and still freezing in the mornings and at night, although they&#x2019;d had more than a few hazy warm days the past two months that fooled everyone into thinking spring was really here; even the black cherry trees were confused&#x2014;fruit had prematurely formed on the branches, then iced over and broke off the next week in a storm.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The girls had been in the store a long time.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie looked at the time on her phone. 11:32 a.m. They still had to go to Kmart for a gift for Kylie&#x2019;s friend, which meant they would argue about the under-ten-dollar rule, then engage in negotiations until they got to an under-ten-dollar-without-tax agreement. If there was time, maybe Jamie could browse for something for her aunt Maggie, whose birthday was coming up. Maggie was fond of her, and Jamie didn&#x2019;t really know why&#x2014;maybe because she admired Jamie&#x2019;s pluck, maybe because she&#x2019;d been a single mother herself after Uncle Stu had left her for a girl in a massage parlor twenty years ago, and she knew how rough it was. Maybe because it was a way to piss off her sister, Jamie&#x2019;s mother, which she enjoyed doing for a list of reasons either one would tell you all about if you asked them. Jamie ultimately didn&#x2019;t care about the details since Aunt Maggie had cleaned up in the divorce and got her real estate agent&#x2019;s license in short order, owned half a dozen homes in the Poconos that she rented out to vacationers, and brokered deals between buyers and the new developments surrounding Denville.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Goddammit,&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She got out of the car and jogged into the mini-mart, scanned the inside quickly and saw only one other person&#x2014;a man, looking at a porn magazine.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Hey,&#x201d; she said to the fat boy behind the counter. He seemed too old for the braces on his teeth.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;He jumped.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You see two girls in here?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yeah. They went to the bathroom in back.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie did not say thank you, walked past the guy with the porn and out the back door. She saw Kylie leaning against the cinder block wall, holding a Reese&#x2019;s cup between her thumb and forefinger like a teacup.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What the hell, Kylie?&#x201d; said Jamie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;She had to pee. She said it was an emergency.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie stormed past, rapped on the bathroom door and said, &#x201c;Bailey, come on, let&#x2019;s move it.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m washing my hands,&#x201d; said Bailey from inside.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;You&#x2019;re done. Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying not to touch anything.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie almost smiled. She had been trying to teach them to line the toilet seat with paper towels, hover above the bowl, and turn the faucets on and off with their elbows in public bathrooms.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I have Purell in the car. Come on.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The door opened and Bailey came out. She looked at her mother and covered her mouth with her hands.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;We forgot the coffee!&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;It&#x2019;s okay,&#x201d; said Jamie. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s go.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;They went back to the car and drove to the Ridgewood Mall without speaking, Kylie staring out the window, Bailey reading her school work�book. Jamie glanced at both of them and thought they looked nice. Bai�ley in a pink princess dress, Kylie in a black dress with a purple flower print and the sweetheart neckline that was a little too old for her, Jamie thought, but since it was a hand-me-down from her cousin, she could not complain. They are both so big, she thought, which makes me so old.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;The parking lot was surprisingly not crowded, the first three or four rows of the grid full but that was it. God bless Spring Fest, Jamie thought.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;So what does Arianna want?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Aren&#x2019;t we coming in?&#x201d; said Kylie, shocked.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No way. I&#x2019;m going in and out.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Come on. That&#x2019;s so unfair!&#x201d; they both said.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Deal with it,&#x201d; said Jamie. &#x201c;What does she like?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kylie sighed. &#x201c;She wants a sleeping bag.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;I&#x2019;m not buying her a sleeping bag. Does she like jewelry?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Kylie nodded.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Great. I&#x2019;ll get her some bracelets.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie looked through her purse for her phone and her wallet, left the key in the ignition so the heat would stay on.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Can we at least listen to music?&#x201d; said Kylie.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;Yes, you can. I&#x2019;ll be back in five minutes.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie got out and was about to slam the door when Bailey said, &#x201c;Mom?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;What?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She looked up from her book and said, &#x201c;Do you know you call a group of lions a pride, not a pack?&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Jamie stared at her, then at Kylie, who rolled her eyes.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;&#x201c;No, baby, I didn&#x2019;t know that.&#x201d;<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;She shut the door and left them.<br>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Into the calm, controlled air of Kmart, pop music from ten years ago in her ears, she forced herself to stay focused. If she didn&#x2019;t have a list, she had trouble concentrating in big box stores, got distracted by displays and sales. That was the point, wasn&#x2019;t it, she thought, to turn you into a kid again who sees something shiny and wants it. Whe...</p><h2>Reid Railton: Man of Speed</h2><p>Reid Antony Railton, Cheshire-born automotive engineer par excellence, created an extraordinary range of cars. He rose to renown during the 1930s as chief engineer at Thomson &amp; Taylor, Brooklands-based racing-car builders. There he realised the dreams of that era's top men of speed, including Tim Birkin, Malcolm Campbell, Whitney Straight, John Cobb, Raymond Mays and Goldie Gardner. His great cars powered them all to sensational racing and record-breaking success. This magisterial book, by one of the world's foremost automotive historians, tells Reid Railton's personal and professional story in superb detail and fascinating depth, with special focus on Reid's unique insights--amounting to genius--and technical accomplishments.</p><p><p><b>Karl Ludvigsen</b> is respected as a close and knowledgeable observer of, and participant in, the world motor industry. In addition to his industry activities as an executive with GM, Fiat and Ford and head of a consulting company, he has been active for over 60 years as an author and historian. As an author, co-author or editor he has some five dozen books to his credit, all concerning cars and the motor industry, his life-long passion. Many have been garlanded for their high standard of writing and research. An American, he lives in the UK, in Suffolk.</p>"Karl Ludvigsen&#x2019;s <i>Reid Railton: Man of Speed</i> is an exceptional account of one of history&#x2019;s pre-eminent engineers. Gifted with immense talent, Railton was a brilliant man who led a remarkable life and whose contributions resonate to this day.

DeLorenzo, Publisher and Editor-in-Chief, Autoextremist.com</i></b><br><br>"Too often the designer and engineer, without whom there would be no car, are all but forgotten. This fascinating book, <i>Reid Railton: Man of Speed</i>, goes a long way to balance the scales by, for the first time, shining a light on the distinguished career of Reid Railton, a talented designer and engineer, who if fate had been kinder would today be as widely known as Henry Royce."<b><i> - Sir Greg Knight, MP,</i></b><br><br>"There can be few, if any, characters connected with the history of motor racing more under-appreciated than Reid Antony Railton.

And this is a record-breaking book: enchanting, original, fascinating, technically scrupulous and immaculately researched. But there&#x2019;s also touching nostalgia for a long-lost moment when Britannia ruled the roads as well as the waves. With <i>Man of Speed</i> Karl Ludvigsen crowns himself the outstanding historian of the motor car."<b><i> - Stephen Bayley, Author, critic, columnist, consultant, broadcaster, debater and curator</i></b><br><br>"Karl Ludvigsen has produced a thoroughly informative and authoritative biography about one of the most influential design engineers of fast cars of any era. Without Reid Railton&#x2019;s incredible ingenuity, foresight and knowledge of aerodynamics, my amazing grandfather Sir Malcolm Campbell would never have achieved his enormous success. And when I was a little girl I remember my dear father Donald Campbell waxing lyrical about this man Reid Railton and what a born genius he was."<b><i> - Gina Campbell, QSO, Grand-daughter of Sir Malcolm Campbell and daughter of Donald Campbell CBE</i></b><br><br>"I can only describe this book as absolutely magnificent. Karl Ludvigsen charts the life and times of Reid Railton in extraordinary detail and the confidence and scale of his research and knowledge is nothing short of astounding. As land speed record enthusiasts we know all about the Campbells and Segraves, but very little about Cobb and almost nothing about Railton, the engineer in the margins of history who made so many of the great British records possible. Not any more. This very special book for every motor racing enthusiast gets pride of place in my library. It is a brilliant read."<b><i> - Richard Noble, OBE, Land speed record holder 1987�??93 and project director of supersonic cars</i></b></p><h2>My Amish Childhood: A True Story of Faith, Family, and the Simple Life</h2><p><p>Bestselling fiction author Jerry S.

She lives in Massachusetts and Maine with her husband.</p>Developers and environmentalists do battle over a deserted lighthouse in Page's 13th absorbing "body" book (after 2002's The Body in the Bonfire) to feature Faith Fairchild, caterer, sometime sleuth and mother of two small children. Faith and her minister husband, Tom, who live most of the year in Aleford, Mass., are fixing up their cottage on Maine's Sanpere Island, where "mansionization"-the construction of trophy houses by rich summer people-is making the locals resentful. One evening the falling tide reveals the body of developer Harold Hapswell "wedged between two granite ledges at the base of the old lighthouse... as if he'd been filed between the two large rocks." Suspecting Hapswell's death was no accident, Faith has her worst fears confirmed when she herself is attacked on a walk near the lighthouse. Beneath the tranquil and festive summer activities, including the island-wide Fish and Fritter Fry and an amateur production of Romeo and Juliet, lurk arson and murder. Along with thematically related recipes, the author appends a moving afterword about the impact of September 11 on the novel's composition.

There is candor in this book, and humor and an exhilarating sense, once common to us but now strange, that Americans who fought that war could do just about anything, and without getting wordy or pretentious about it or themselves." --<i>The Washington Post</i><br><br>In this remarkable oral history collection, 33 participants in the turbulent epic that began with the day of infamy at Pearl Harbor and ended with the signing of the surrender documents in Tokyo Harbor tell their stories. Their remembrances of heartbreak, frustration, heroism, hope, and triumph were collected over a period of 25 years by John T. Mason Jr. These recollections reveal perspectives and facts not included in traditional works of history. Each selection, introduced with a preface that places it in the context of the Pacific War, takes the reader behind the scenes to present the personal, untold stories of naval history. Included are Admiral William S. Sullivan's account of the problems involved in clearing Manila Harbor of some 500 wrecked vessels left by the departing Japanese, and Admiral Thomas C. Kinkaid's description of the communications breakdown at the Battle of Leyte Gulf. There are also the very personal recollections of humor and horror told by the unknown actors in the war: the hospital corpsman, the coxswain, and the machinist's mate. Originally published in 1986, this volume is an unusual and lasting tribute to the ingenuity and teamwork demonstrated by America's forces in the Pacific as well as a celebration of the human spirit.</p><p>John T. Mason Jr. (1909-1998) was a trained historian with an advanced degree from George Washington University. He was also an Episcopal priest and graduate of General Theological Seminary. From 1940 to the end of World War II, he served with the Office of Naval Intelligence in Washington, D.C. From 1960 to 1969, he was associated with the oral history research office of Columbia University under the guidance of the noted American historian Allan Nevins. In 1969, Mason established an oral history program at the U.S. Naval Institute, and it soon led to one of the most extensive collections of naval oral history transcripts in the country. In 1982, he retired as director of the Naval Institute Oral History Program, which continues to carry on his legacy today.</p><h2>The Border Is Burning</h2><p><p>Loners, families, fathers, wives--anyone who lives on the border between Mexico and the United States also lives on a border of violence and complexity.

Nevertheless, in a society that achieved the marvelous accuracy of construction revealed in the Pyramids, extensive systems of irrigation canals, the erection of large granaries, levying and collecting of taxes, and other evidences of a well-organized and highly developed culture, mathematics must have played a major role.<br>In this remarkably erudite work, the first book-length study of ancient Egyptian mathematics, Professor Gillings examines the development of Egyptian mathematics from its origins in commercial and practical computations to such accomplishments as the solution of problems in direct and inverse proportion; the solution of linear equations of the first degree; determining the sum of arithmetical and geometrical progressions, and the use of rudimentary trigonometric functions in describing the slopes of pyramids. Drawing on all the extant sources &#x2014; Egyptian Mathematical Leather Roll, the Reisner Papyri, the Moscow Mathematical Papyrus, and, most extensively, the Rhind Mathematical Papyrus, a training manual for scribes- the author shows that although the mathematical operations of the ancient Egyptians were limited in number, they were adaptable to a great many applications. Professor Gillings is also at pains to debunk such myths as the numerical mysticism that arose in connection with the construction of the great Pyramids, and the oft-repeated assertion that the Egyptians were conversant with the Pythagorean Theorem.<br>Enhanced with photographs of age-old papyri and other artifacts, as well as the author's own calligraphic renderings of hieroglyphic and hieratic words and numerals, this carefully researched and well-presented study will fascinate Egyptologists, mathematicians, engineers, archaeologists, and any student or admirer of the remarkable civilization that flourished on the shores of the Nile so many centuries ago.</p><p></p></p><p></p><h2>Calming the Rush of Panic: A Mindfulness-Based Stress Reduction Guide to Freeing Yourself from Panic Attacks &amp; Living a Vital Life</h2><p><p> Do you constantly feel anxious?

Nazi officials saw Islam as a powerful force with the same enemies as Germany: the British Empire, the Soviet Union, and the Jews. <i>Islam and Nazi Germany's War</i> is the first comprehensive account of Berlin's remarkably ambitious attempts to build an alliance with the Islamic world.<br> <br> Drawing on archival research in three continents, David Motadel explains how German officials tried to promote the Third Reich as a patron of Islam.

Combining measured argument with a masterly handling of detail, it illuminates the profound impact of the Second World War on Muslims around the world and provides a new understanding of the politics of religion in the bloodiest conflict of the twentieth century.</p><p>David Motadel is Assistant Professor of International History at the London School of Economics and Political Science (LSE).&#x201c;Motadel describes the Mufti&#x2019;s Nazi dealings vividly, but he also excels in unearthing other odious and fascinating characters...

It is academically impeccable, drawing on a wealth of archival resources in a multitude of languages, yet it wears its erudition lightly. In the current climate, a subject such as this might be considered controversial. Motadel, however, is never less than resolutely serious and rigorous. The whiff of sensationalism never offends the nostrils... Motadel&#x2019;s book is a brilliantly original study that achieves that rare feat of combining rigor with accessibility. Most impressively, in the hugely crowded field of the second world war and Nazi Germany, it manages to explore an area of profound significance that had previously been overlooked.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Roger Moorhouse</b><b>, </b><b><i>Financial Times</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Islam and Nazi Germany&#x2019;s War</i> is a valuable ground-breaking work, energetically readable and unabashedly complicated... Through an extensive amount of research in some fairly recondite primary sources, Motadel tells the story of Nazi Germany&#x2019;s interaction with its Muslim conquests and would-be conquests in greater detail and with greater skill than any English-language historian before him. He stresses the at first odd-seeming fact that when it came to dealing with Muslims, the Nazis were almost jarringly accommodating... At heart, Motadel&#x2019;s revelatory book describes a mutual bafflement, and in that sense alone it&#x2019;s perhaps prescient. Either way, <i>Islam and Nazi Germany&#x2019;s War</i> is an indispensable enlargement of our understanding of the Second World War&#x2019;s Eastern European theater.&#x201d;<b><i>&#x2015;</i></b><b>Steve Donoghue</b><b>, </b><b><i>Open Letters Monthly</i></b><br><br>&#x201c;Motadel&#x2019;s treatment of an unsavory segment of modern Muslim history is as revealing as it is nuanced.

In this entertaining volume, Ramon F. Adams, author of the popular Western Words, tell the story of the old cowboy cooks, and the result is another highly original contribution to the folklore of the cattle country.</p> <p>Although the cowboy cleared the Southwestern frontier of savage Indians and opened the land for settlement, the cook and his commissary contributed greatly to the success of the operation; for as an army depends upon its mess-kitchens, so the cowboys depended upon the chuck wagon. Without it, there would have been to trail drives to rescue Texas from bankruptcy following the Civil War, no roundups to speed the development of the cattle industry, and no beef for the heavily populated areas of the United States.</p> <p>The author records the place and influence of the range cook upon Western life. He discusses the functions of &#x201c;coosie,&#x201d; the food he served, and his methods of preparing it-giving recipes for sourdough biscuits, fluff-duffs, son-of-a-bitch stew, and other distinctive dishes of the range. He describes, too, &#x201c;the wagon,&#x201d; its evolution, and its place in the hearts of the men who called it home.</p> <p>Although there remain a few chuck wagons on the larger ranches today, they have become so scarce that one is rarely seen except in a museum or a rodeo parade, and the younger generation of cooks, like the cowboys themselves has been tamed.</p> <p>Every cook was a &#x201c;character,&#x201d; perhaps with reason, for no man ever worked under greater difficulties or with fewer conveniences.

He became a teacher of grammar at Tagaste, and lived much under the influence of his mother and his friend Alypius. About 383 he went to Rome and soon after to Milan as a teacher of rhetoric, being now attracted by the philosophy of the Sceptics and of the Neo-Platonists.

Edgar Hoover, 1965Joe Barboza knew that there were two requirements for getting inducted into the Mafia. You had to be Sicilian. And you had to commit a contract killing. The New Bedford&#x2013;born mobster was a proud Portuguese, not Sicilian, but his dream to be part of La Cosa Nostra proved so strong that he thought he could create a loophole. If he killed enough men, if he did enough of the Mafia&#x2019;s dirtiest biddings, then they would have no choice but to make him a Made Man.Barboza&#x2019;s brutal rise during one of the deadliest mob wars in U.S. history became the stuff of legend, both on the bloodied streets of Boston and in the offices of the FBI and the U.S. Attorney General. He took sick joy in his crimes, and it became increasingly difficult for the mob to keep the Animal on his leash. But soon the hunter became the hunted. Betrayed by the mob and now on the run, Boston&#x2019;s most notorious contract killer forged a Faustian bargain with two unscrupulous FBI agents&#x2014;a pact that would transform the U.S. criminal justice system. From false testimony and manipulated evidence that sent mob leaders to death row, to the creation of the Witness Protection Program so the feds could protect their prized, cold-blooded witness, this was the horrific, dramatic first act in a story of murder and FBI corruption still being played out today in the news and the courtroom with the capture and trial of Whitey Bulger. Barboza&#x2019;s legacy, buried for years thanks to the murders or deaths of its participants, is finally coming to light and being told in its unvarnished brutality by one of America&#x2019;s most respected true crime writers.</p><p>CASEY SHERMAN is a Boston-based journalist and the author of A Rose for Mary: The Hunt for the Real Boston Strangler and Bad Blood: Freedom and Death in the White Mountains, among others.

Animal is a fascinating tale of murder, brutality, and betrayal on both sides of the law; for fans of the gangster genre, it's a must-read." &#x2015;Terence Winter, creator and executive producer of Boardwalk Empire<br><br>"With Animal, author Casey Sherman takes you into the belly of the beast. You ride along with Joe Barboza, one of the most brutal gangsters in the history of American organized crime, during unspeakable acts of murder. Equally important, Sherman reveals how Barboza became a covert FBI informant and played the System until the System was indistinguishable from the criminal underground. An important book written by a skilled storyteller, Animal belongs on a shelf alongside The Valachi Papers, Wiseguy, and other essential works of Mob history." &#x2015;T. J.

Some sources write that his name is not familial, but was invented by him as a French version of the Latin Sanctus Germanus, meaning "Holy Brother"." <i>(Quote from wikipedia.org)</i></p><h2>Judge and Jury: The Life and Times of Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis</h2><p>Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis is most famous for his role as the first Commissioner ever to rule organized baseball. But before he came into his legendary position as baseball's final say, Landis already had built a reputation from his Chicago courtroom as the most popular and most controversial federal judge in World War I-era America. <i>Judge and Jury</i> is the first complete biography of the Squire, from the origins of his unusual name through his career as a federal judge and his clean-up after the infamous Black Sox scandal.</p><p>Baseball's first commissioner cast such a long and powerful shadow over the game, it's often hard to untangle his contribution from his personality, and his life from his lasting myth. The truth that emerges from this exhaustive and engaging biography of Judge Landis has no problem matching the outsized legend stride for stride. Landis moved into the public spotlight to clean up the national pastime after the disgrace of the 1919 World Series, but there was much more to this complex man and his complex career. <i>Judge and Jury</i> chronicles the entirety.<p> A tough, colorful judge, his rulings could be as unpredictable as he was. Landis could be as severe and stubborn as he could be gentle and understanding, characteristics that both defined his decision-making and confused his critics. Noted as a trustbuster--he went head to head with John D. Rockefeller, fining Standard Oil $29 million--he upheld baseball's exemption from antitrust status from the bench. Known for his harsh sentences, he was almost impeached for his leniency to the destitute. As commissioner, he loved the post, the game, and his perceived responsibility as its primary upholder and restorer of virtue: "You have told the world that my powers would be absolute," he warned the owners who hired him. "I wouldn't take this job for all the gold in the world unless I knew my hands were free." In his regime, they pretty much were, and he used them to grab his share of whatever power and glory he could wrap them around. <i>--Jeff Silverman</i></p>In <i>Judge and Jury</i>, author David Pietrusza presents the first extensive and complete life story of the unforgettable Judge Kenesaw Mountain Landis. Pietrusza includes a thorough look at Landis and his impact on baseball as The Game's first commissioner, but he also goes well beyond Landis the baseball man to reveal Landis as a hardnosed juristas well as the many other fascinating facets of the life of this legendary American figure.

What good does it do to stretch, relax, or strengthen muscles if we don't know how these muscles are actually designed to function? To be sound, any physical therapy method must be based on scientific knowledge of how the musculoskeletal system works, on the role of proprioception in gaining awareness and control over this system, and on the process of becoming more conscious in action. Written for both beginning and advanced students, the book offers in-depth explanations of the theory of neurodynamics together with illustrations outlining steps of development and practical exercises. <br><br> Over 100 years ago, F. Matthias Alexander made a series of discoveries about how the body works in action that made it possible for the first time to become conscious of what we're doing in activity. In <i>Neurodynamics</i>, author Theodore Dimon, who has taught and written about Alexander's work for many years, seeks to put together a coherent theory and curriculum for the Alexander Technique and explain how this system works in scientific terms. <i>Neurodynamics</i> develops and expands on Alexander's teachings and gives practical explanations that form the basis not just for a method but for a truly educational theory of how the mind and body work in action.</p><p>THEODORE DIMON, JR., is the director of the Dimon Institute in New York City and an adjunct professor at Columbia Teachers College.

Her story begins as a young girl in seventeenth century Spain, in a convent her home that she would never physically leave during her sixty three years. Maria Jesus de Agreda was a devout Spanish nun who dedicated her life to the Catholic faith. She would become a legend in areas of Arizona, New Mexico, and Texas without ever stepping foot outside of her country, or her own hometown. <br>At the age of eighteen, Maria experienced the first of what would become many mystical transitions from the physical world into the spiritual. One day during prayer in the convent, Maria reportedly went into a trance-like state. A beggar who had come to the convent to pray witnessed the event and reported that a blue light suddenly enveloped the young nun as she knelt. The light was said to have lifted her several feet above the floor as she remained unmoving and seemingly still in prayer. <br>As time went on, Maria began to experience these trances during her daily routine. She said that she was blessed with visions in which she saw dark-colored people in the wilderness of the Southwestern United States. She said she often spoke with them and shared her faith with them in hopes that they would seek out the word of God. It is believed she made over 500 of these visits in a process known as bi-location, teleportation, or as astral projection the ability to physically be in one place and spiritually in another at the same time. <br>Maria would often visit the Jumano Indian people of Texas, which resulted in their desire to receive instruction in the Catholic Faith. During her visitations, it is said that she came to them speaking their native tongue, though she had never learned their language. When asked about this peculiarity she said that she simply traveled to deliver a message and God provided her a way to communicate with the Indians. Five years after her death in 1665, a book she authored titled The Mystical City of God was published. It outlined her extraordinary views and experiences and is said to be one of the most controversial texts in the history of the church. <br>Throughout the recent centuries many people have often reported seeing the spirit of the Lady in Blue visit them in times of need, sickness, or desperation. In the 1840s it is reported that she appeared in Sabinetown to care for those afflicted by a black tongue epidemic, and suddenly disappeared when the illness was finally under control. Her legend lives on in Southwestern Texas where many believe she is constantly watching over them, still performing in death the work she loved in life."</p><h2>The Freedom of the Streets: Work, Citizenship, and Sexuality in a Gilded Age City (Gender and American Culture)</h2><p>Gilded Age cities offered extraordinary opportunities to women--but at a price. As clerks, factory hands, and professionals flocked downtown to earn a living, they alarmed social critics and city fathers, who warned that self-supporting women were just steps away from becoming prostitutes. With in-depth research possible only in a mid-sized city, Sharon E. Wood focuses on Davenport, Iowa, to explore the lives of working women and the prostitutes who shared their neighborhoods. <br><br>The single, self-supporting women who migrated to Davenport in the years following the Civil War saw paid labor as the foundation of citizenship. They took up the tools of public and political life to assert the respectability of paid employment and to confront the demon of prostitution. Wood offers cradle-to-grave portraits of individual girls and women--both prostitutes and "respectable" white workers--seeking to reshape their city and expand women's opportunities. As Wood demonstrates, however, their efforts to rewrite the sexual politics of the streets met powerful resistance at every turn from men defending their political rights and sexual power.<br><br></p><p>"A meticulous and imaginative use of sources. . . . A remarkably rich and nuanced portrait of Davenport's prostitutes. . . . Packed with compelling and richly detailed vignettes."-- <i>Business History Review</i> <br>Wood examines the network of single, white women who migrated to Davenport, Iowa, during and after the Civil War in pursuit of wages and professional advancement. The many personal stories included here demonstrate the development of women&#39;s political activism as well as the unintended consequences of efforts to control prostitution.</p><h2>Deluge: Book Three of The Twins of Petaybee</h2><p>InterGal Corporation has long desired to exploit the resource-rich Petaybee.

He stopped at the drawbridge and took in the splendor of the majestic castle Pyron Mid. The gate towers stood tall as if to proclaim it an impenetrable fortress that no army in the kingdom could ever hope to seize. If Fairos were to fall, it would be for one reason only: The King wanted it. Such was the case, and so it was that Leinad was chosen to accomplish the impossible. Unsure of the future but obedient to and confident in the King, Leinad was willing to be the King&#x2019;s sword. And so Leinad had prepared himself to challenge the mightiest force in the entire kingdom. In his heart he knew the King was with him. <br><br>The moments passed, and Leinad&#x2019;s stillness began to draw attention. Normally a visiting nobleman would cross the drawbridge and announce himself to the gate guards. Leinad waited beyond the threshold, a clear message of insult never before witnessed at Pyron Mid. The keeper of the gate called for another guard, and after a short exchange between the two, he called down to Leinad. <br><br>&#x201c;Sir, state your name and your intentions. We shall herald your arrival to Lord Fairos.&#x201d; <br><br>Leinad paused before speaking. &#x201c;My message is for Fairos only.&#x201d; Slaves, overseers, and guards within listening distance stopped and gazed at Leinad in growing curiosity. <br><br><i>&#x201c;Lord </i>Fairos is not expecting visitors, and he will not come dancing to your whims, sir,&#x201d; the guard replied. &#x201c;I suggest you depart at once.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;My message is from the King, and I will wait here until Fairos hears it!&#x201d; <br><br>The gatekeeper and the other guard exchanged words again, and the guard disappeared. <br><br>Time passed, and Leinad continued to wait. He suspected that Fairos was in no hurry to respond and was sending his own message by his delay. A general movement of people toward the front of the castle was evident as word of Leinad&#x2019;s arrival spread. <br><br>A group of slaves under the close watch of an overseer was returning to the castle with a supply of bricks. As they passed, an adolescent boy caught Leinad&#x2019;s eye. Leinad smiled with compassion at the young lad, whose face revealed the weariness and subjection of a slave without hope. In a moment of transformation, the lad&#x2019;s face brightened in hope and disbelief. He turned to the slave next to him, and Leinad could hear the excitement in his voice. <br><br>&#x201c;It&#x2019;s Leinad!&#x201d; he exclaimed.<br><br>&#x201c;Leinad&#x2019;s dead, boy,&#x201d; the man retorted. &#x201c;And this man&#x2019;s a dead man too.&#x201d; The man turned to look, but the overseer shouted and cracked his whip above their heads.<br><br>Fairos finally appeared on the gate wall above Leinad with an air of authority and arrogance. Keston, the captain of the guards, and five of his men appeared in the gate below a moment later.<br><br>&#x201c;Tell me, sir!&#x201d; Fairos shouted. &#x201c;Who is it that insults me with his presence and an absurd message from a make believe king?&#x201d;<br><br>Leinad sat tall upon Freedom. &#x201c;My name is Leinad, and I come by the authority of the King and by the might of His sword. I do not wish for harm to fall upon you or any of your men. Hear the words of the King: &#x2018;Let My people go!&#x2019;&#x201d; <br><br>Fairos did not move or respond, but the people did. An audible rumble of voices flowed like a wave around the castle. Keston responded too. Leinad had humiliated Keston before his own men. His anger was obvious. He drew his sword and advanced with the five guards. Partway to the drawbridge, Fairos spoke.<br><br>&#x201c;Hold, Keston!&#x201d; He paused. &#x201c;Well, you certainly are not a nobleman, but rather a slave with no name in Nyland.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I am no slave, but I <i>am </i>a servant...a servant of the one true King and His people,&#x201d; Leinad said.<br><br>By now all labor had ceased, and most of the castle guards were on the wall or exiting the gate below to see the activity beyond.<br><br>&#x201c;Kill him, Keston!&#x201d; Fairos commanded.<br><br>Keston and the five guards resumed their advance toward the drawbridge. Leinad dismounted on the far side of the bridge and drew his sword. When Keston reached the bridge, he halted his men. <br><br>&#x201c;Stay here&#x2013;I will finish him myself!&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Leinad walked onto the drawbridge toward the castle. Keston&#x2019;s gait was sharp and full of fury.<br><br>The two met near the middle of the bridge, and Keston did not break his stride or offer the greeting of mutual respect normally exchanged before such a fight.<br><br>Keston&#x2019;s sword struck first with intense aggressiveness. Although Leinad had seen Keston train and fight, he had learned from his father never to underestimate his opponent. He parried Keston&#x2019;s barrage of cuts and slices and studied him. Keston&#x2019;s frustration became increasingly obvious as he attacked with combination after combination against an opponent whose defense was flawless. Leinad matched Keston&#x2019;s speed and power while he held his ground.<br><br>&#x201c;I have no quarrel with you, Keston,&#x201d; Leinad said. &#x201c;It is Fairos I must face.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You will only face Lord Fairos on your back after I am through with you, bleeding and dying at his feet!&#x201d; Keston said in a rage. &#x201c;That sword will belong to me once and for all!&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Very well, Keston. The choice is yours.&#x201d;<br><br>Leinad deflected Keston&#x2019;s last offensive cut, and his last cut it was, for Leinad began an advance that brought gasps from the onlookers. With increasing speed and power,<br><br>Leinad&#x2019;s sword sliced through the air faster than Keston could counter. With each break in Keston&#x2019;s defense, Leinad made precision cuts in his flesh. First, the tip of Leinad&#x2019;s sword cut through Keston&#x2019;s left shoulder&#x2013;then his right thigh&#x2013;then his abdomen. Within a moment, Keston was bleeding from a dozen places, but his sword arm was still whole. Leinad&#x2019;s dominance was obvious, and Keston was growing weak from exhaustion and loss of blood. His rage turned to submission and defeat.<br><br>In a last-chance effort, Keston tried to deflect a chest high cut and lunged forward with a thrust at Leinad&#x2019;s chest. Leinad easily parried the thrust to his left and executed a powerful bind on Keston&#x2019;s sword that forced it from his grip. Without a sword and bleeding from all over his body, Keston fell to his knees before Leinad with his arms open wide.<br><br>&#x201c;Have mercy, Leinad,&#x201d; Keston pleaded. &#x201c;My life is in your hands.&#x201d;<br><br>Just then Fairos, full of rage, broke through the crowd and started across the drawbridge.<br><br>Leinad stood before Keston with his sword pointed at Keston&#x2019;s chest. &#x201c;As I said, Keston, I have no quarrel with you. Swear that you will raise no sword against me or the King&#x2019;s people, and you shall live.&#x201d; <br><br>&#x201c;I swear&#x2013;&#x201d;<br><br>A sword cut through his chest from behind.<br><br>&#x201c;You have disgraced me and all of Nyland!&#x201d; Fairos withdrew his sword from Keston&#x2019;s body. &#x201c;No one does this to Lord Fairos and lives!&#x201d;<br><br>Keston fell to the ground and died. Leinad stepped back in horror, amazed that Fairos was capable of such ruthlessness to one of his own. Fairos raised his sword to Leinad with hatred in his eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;You are a worthless slave, and I will dispense with you once and for all.&#x201d;<br><br>The last time Leinad had fought Fairos, he&#x2019;d faced death at the edge of Fairos&#x2019;s sword. But that was before he met the King. This time was different, and so was Leinad. His sword belonged to the King, and so did his mission. He remained silent and prepared himself for the fight, for he knew that Fairos had shut his ears to words.<br><br>The two men engaged each other. Both were extremely skilled&#x2013;both were very aware of the other&#x2019;s mastery. Fairos&#x2019;s arrogance was obvious, and he made an offensive advance as if to probe Leinad&#x2019;s abilities. The swords screamed through the air, steel to steel. Fairos brought a powerful slice across Leinad&#x2019;s torso. Leinad met the sword with the flat of his blade and countered with a quick cut across Fairos&#x2019;s chest. Fairos could not regain protection with his sword in time and jerked his body backward to escape the deadly edge of Leinad&#x2019;s blade. Seeing that Fairos was off balance, Leinad brought another slice from the right. Fairos pulled his sword across his body to meet Leinad&#x2019;s sword, but the force of impact was too much to counter, and the razor sharp edge of Leinad&#x2019;s sword cut into Fairos&#x2019;s left shoulder. <br><br>Fairos did not flinch from the pain, and the wound did not appear to be deep. He paused and glared at Leinad and then at the blood trickling down his arm. Leinad knew that Fairos had been victorious against many mighty enemies, but he saw something in Fairos&#x2019;s expression that he had never seen before&#x2013;fear.<br><br>Leinad allowed Fairos his moment of reflection and was thankful for a break to regain his breath and his composure. He was strained but not exhausted. The King had not only trained him beyond mastery, but had conditioned him as well. The few times Leinad had fought outside of training, he had dealt with fear himself. Now, however, there was no fear within him. He was not fighting for his life; he was fighting for the King and for the people. He carried the mission, the sword, and the skill of the King with him.<br><br>By now the people watching from the castle and all the other onlookers were nearly still, watching two masters fight to the death. Those on the fringes of the scene were compelled to draw closer.<br><br>From the heights of the castle gate wall, Lady Fairos and her son watched with apprehension. &#x201c;Kill him, Father! Kill him!&#x201d; the boy screamed.<br><br>Leinad readied himself for the next engagement. &#x201c;The King demands the freedom of His people,&#x201d; Leinad said sternly. &#x201c;Release them and no one will die.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;You are a fool to believe that I would give you that which has made me great,&#x201d; Fairos said.<br><br>Fairos attacked with renewed fury, as a warrior fighting for his life and his reputation. The sound of the clashing swords rang out over the silence of the awestruck crowd. The fight moved from one side of the drawbridge to the other.<br><br>Leinad became more aggressive and advanced relentlessly on Fairos until he was nearly off the castle end of the drawbridge. Both men were beginning to tire, but Fairos&#x2019;s fight began to look desperate. He returned an aggressive combination to put Leinad in retreat. As Leinad moved back, he stumbled over Keston&#x2019;s body and fell backward onto the drawbridge decking. Fairos, seeing an opportunity to finish the fight, brought a two-handed cut from above his head down toward Leinad, who was lying faceup. Leinad rolled to the side. Fairos&#x2019;s blade tore into the wood of the decking, just missing Leinad&#x2019;s shoulder.<br><br>Leinad&#x2019;s rolling maneuver threw him off the drawbridge, and he was just able to stop his plunge into the moat by grabbing the edge with his left hand. He kept his grip on his sword, knowing that Fairos would be on him in an instant. He placed his sword and right hand on the deck of the drawbridge to lift himself, but Fairos slammed his foot down on the flat blade of Leinad&#x2019;s sword, pinning it to the deck. Leinad looked up into the sneering face of Fairos.<br><br>&#x201c;Well, slave, it looks like you have failed again. I am king here. Your death will be my proclamation!&#x201d;<br><br>Fairos raised his sword to deal his final blow to Leinad. In an instant, Leinad used his left elbow as leverage and pulled with all his might to yank the sword from beneath Fairos&#x2019;s foot. The smooth steel of the blade slid easily on the decking. Fairos&#x2019;s foot slid forward with the blade, and he fell backward onto the drawbridge near its edge. Leinad threw his sword on the drawbridge and swung his body away from Fairos and onto the decking. Fairos was preoccupied with keeping himself from falling into the moat, which allowed Leinad enough time to reach his sword.<br><br>When the scrambling was over, the two men once again faced each other.<br><br>The fight wore on, the two swords a relentless blur. The onlookers continued to assemble and position themselves for a better view.<br><br>Leinad drove the fight hard, and Fairos could only defend and retreat. The endurance of the prime of youth, the masterful training of the King, and the sword of deliverance overcame the ruthlessness of a battle experienced warrior and his arrogance. Leinad&#x2019;s continual barrage of powerful and precisely placed cuts eventually drove Fairos to the ground and onto his back. His sword was still in hand, but there was no more fight in him. With one final massive crosscut, Fairos&#x2019;s sword was blown from his grip. It skidded across the drawbridge and plunged into the murky waters of the moat below.<br><br>The mighty Lord Fairos lay helpless before his &#x201c;slave.&#x201d; Both men were breathing hard, and sweat poured from their faces.<br><br>&#x201c;I will not plead for mercy like Keston, slave,&#x201d; Fairos said with disgust between breaths.<br><br>Leinad stood over Fairos with the shining blade of his sword aimed at Fairos&#x2019;s chest. &#x201c;Let the people go, Fairos,&#x201d; Leinad commanded.<br><br>&#x201c;I will never let them go. You will have to kill me!&#x201d;<br><br>Leinad looked at the guards, overseers, and slaves&#x2013;all stunned, waiting for his action. He didn&#x2019;t want any more bloodshed. If he killed Fairos, the loyal guards could turn the scene into a massacre of the slaves. He needed Fairos to order the release of the people. It would be the only peaceful way to free them. He looked down at Fairos and stared into his eyes.<br><br>&#x201c;No, Fairos, I will not kill you. I will do something far worse than that to you. I will let you live. You will live with the shame that a lowly slave on a mission from the King defeated you.&#x201d; He withdrew his sword and held it high in the air. He turned and faced the people.<br><br>&#x201c;People of Nyland!&#x201d; he shouted. &#x201c;Let it be known that by the might of the King&#x2019;s sword, mighty Fairos was defeated. I challenge Fairos to another contest tomorrow. If he defeats me, I will serve as a slave under his hand until my heart beats no more. If I am victorious, let this be proof that the King reigns and that He will bring judgment upon you for enslaving His people.&#x201d;<br><br>Leinad sheathed his sword and glared at Fairos once more. &#x201c;If there is any honor left in you, meet me here tomorrow.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;I will meet you and kill you, slave!&#x201d; Fairos said.<br><br>Leinad walked past him to his horse, Freedom. TESS HAD BEEN WITH A large procession of slaves returning with a new load of bricks for the castle when she first saw the crowd gathered about the drawbridge. As the slave caravan moved closer, Tess watched the last sequence of the fight between the two men and sensed something familiar about one of them, even from a distance.<br><br>She tried to move faster, but the nearest overseer detained her. Her mind dared not think the impossible, but she could not quench the hope rising within her heart. For weeks she had mourned the death of Leinad. Then, when he spoke to the crowd, she felt as though her stomach flipped within her. She broke from the other slaves and ran toward the drawbridge<br>despite the severe punishment she knew she would receive. The mere thought that her dearest friend might still be alive was all she needed to abandon caution and seek out the truth.<br><br>Leinad had finished speaking as she passed Barak at the head of the slave caravan.<br><br>&#x201c;Leinad!&#x201d; she called.<br><br>Barak released the coils of his whip and unleashed a vicious lash toward her back. &#x201c;Back in line, slave!&#x201d; he bellowed as the tip of his whip tore into h...</p><h2>If This Is Love, Why Do I Feel So Insecure?: Learn How to Deal With Anxiety, Jealousy, and Depression in Romance--and Get the Love You Deserve!</h2><p>It doesn&#39;t have to hurt to be in love, yet for many otherwisde accomplished and confident people, romantic involvement means anxiety, insecurity, and pain.

But to disdain Roosevelt&#x2019;s politics is to overlook his important and lasting contributions to the shape of modern America, says the author of this compelling new study of the 26th president of the United States. Joshua Hawley examines Roosevelt&#x2019;s political thought more deeply than ever before to arrive at a fully revised understanding of his legacy: Roosevelt galvanized a twenty-year period of national reform that permanently altered American politics and Americans&#x2019; expectations for government, social progress, and presidents.</p><p>The book explores the historical context of Theodore Roosevelt&#x2019;s politics, its intellectual sources, its practice, and its effect on his era and our own. Hawley finds that Roosevelt developed a coherent political science centered on the theme of righteousness, and this &#x201c;warrior republicanism&#x201d; was what made the progressive era possible. The debates of Roosevelt&#x2019;s era were driven largely by his ideas, and from those debates emerged the grammar of our contemporary politics. Casting new light on the fertility and breadth of Roosevelt&#x2019;s thought, Hawley reveals the full extent of his achievement in twentieth-century intellectual history.</p></p><p></p><h2>Frank Lloyd Wright&#39;s Robie House: The Illustrated Story of an Architectural Masterpiece (Dover Architecture)</h2><p><p>Frank Lloyd Wright firmly believed that "life could be formed anew if new form could be brought to its setting, architecture." His revolt against customary architectural design was shared by rugged individualist Fred C. Robie, who chose Wright to build his dream house in 1908 &#x2014; a structure that was eventually named a World Heritage Site by UNESCO. In this painstakingly researched and illuminating account of the design and construction of the Robie home, a noted architectural authority presents an in-depth study remarkable for clarity and thoroughness.<br>At age 28, Robie had become a highly successful businessman who conceived the idea of building a grand home in his native Chicago. He insisted on a design incorporating features that were innovative for the day: hallways and stairwells situated to conserve valuable space, rooms that suggested feelings of airiness, and narrow trimmings on doorways and windows, among others. Robie's wish to shape space as a means of personal expression meshed with Wright's own feelings and spirit. The two strong-willed men formed a perfect union: Robie had found his architect and Wright his ideal client.<br>Drawing on revealing family documents, including a 1958 interview with Robie, and a host of other sources, the author has compiled an authoritative photo-history, enabling the reader to witness each stage and various transformations of a landmark of modern architecture. The text is enhanced by 160 carefully selected illustrations, including perspectives and elevations, cross-sectional drawings, floor plans, designs for windows, carpets, lighting fixtures and other furnishings, plus recent and historic photographs. Now students, architects, any lover of fine buildings can watch an architectural masterpiece take shape in this profusely illustrated history of the house Wright himself labeled "a source of world-wide architectural inspiration."</p><p></p></p><p>American architect Frank Lloyd Wright (1867&#x2013;1959) designed more than 1,000 structures in a career that spanned eight decades.

Thoughtful interpretive essays by urban historians Michael Ebner, Henry Binford, Janice Reiff, Susan Hirsch, and Robert Bruegmann explore how the city&#x2019;s communities have changed and grown throughout the years, and sixty historic and contemporary photographs and additional maps add depth to each entry.<br> From the South Side to the West Side to the North Side, just about every local knows how distinctive Chicago&#x2019;s neighborhoods are. Few of us, however, know exactly how they came to be. <i>Chicago Neighborhoods and Suburbs</i> brings the city&#x2014;its inimitable neighborhoods, industries, and individuals&#x2014;to life, making it the perfect guidebook for anyone with an interest in Chicago and its history.</p> <p></p></p><p><b>Ann Durkin Keating</b> is professor of history at North Central College in Naperville, Illinois.

Nancy Anderson is an extraordinary career consultant. Her clients pay thousands of dollars for the information in her book, Work with Passion.

It is filled with inspirational guidance of all kinds: from the broadest kinds of visionary encouragement to very practical tips on networking, developing a resume, and writing a query letter that gets results. This wonderfully comprehensive course in career consulting is for everyone who would rather speak proudly of their career than complain about their job. Join those who have already learned the secrets of career success and the joys of working at what they love the most.</p><p>First published in 1984, and now reprinted in an anniversary edition, this book contains concepts as pertinent today as they were 20 years ago. The first chapter opens with the question, "Are you as happy on Monday morning as you are on Friday morning?" Anderson, a career counselor, believes that people who love their work will be. She sets out to help readers identify their passions and determine how those interests can translate into a career that pays the bills. More emotionally charged than most career books, this volume also delves into the meaning of personal history and childhood events, and carefully considers feelings, self-perception and motivation. Points are illustrated with detailed real-life stories of Anderson&#x2019;s clients. It&#x2019;s not all smooth sailing for the case study subjects, who experience "the normal anxiety and fear that are part of risk-taking" and have been hit by "the need for security that can draw us back into the familiar." To facilitate a realistic transition, Anderson&#x2019;s thorough process goes beyond simply identifying what one wants to do and explains how to research, network and even strike out on one&#x2019;s own in order to achieve a passion-worthy career.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Kennedy</h2><p><p>John F. Kennedy died almost half a century ago-yet because of his extraordinary promise and untimely death, his star still resonates strongly. On the anniversary of his assassination, celebrated political scientist and analyst Larry J. Sabato-himself a teenager in the early 1960s and inspired by JFK and his presidency-explores the fascinating and powerful influence he has had over five decades on the media, the general public, and especially on each of his nine presidential successors.</p><p> A recent Gallup poll gave JFK the highest job approval rating of any of those successors, and millions remain captivated by his one thousand days in the White House. For all of them, and for those who feel he would not be judged so highly if he hadn't died tragically in office, The Kennedy Half-Century will be particularly revealing. Sabato reexamines JFK's assassination using heretofore unseen information to which he has had unique access, then documents the extraordinary effect the assassination has had on Americans of every modern generation through the most extensive survey ever undertaken on the public's view of a historical figure. The full and fascinating results, gathered by the accomplished pollsters Peter Hart and Geoff Garin, paint a compelling portrait of the country a half-century after the epochal killing. Just as significantly, Sabato shows how JFK's presidency has strongly influenced the policies and decisions-often in surprising ways-of every president since.</p><p> Among the hundreds of books devoted to JFK, The Kennedy Half-Century stands apart for its rich insight and original perspective. Anyone who reads it will appreciate in new ways the profound impact JFK's short presidency has had on our national psyche.</p></p><p><p><b>Larry J. Sabato</b> is the founder and director of the renowned Center for Politics at the University of Virginia. He has appeared on dozens of national television and radio programs, including <i>60 Minutes, Today, Hardball,</i> and <i>Nightline</i>. He has coanchored the BBC's coverage of U.S. presidential returns and inaugurations, and has authored or edited more than a dozen books on American politics, including the highly praised<i> A More Perfect Constitution-Why the Constitution Must Be Revised: Ideas to Inspire a New Generation</i>.

Kennedy, Sabato shows how Kennedy was transformed from a charismatic, if flawed, man into a mythological figure on the scale of Abraham Lincoln. Sabato goes far beyond Kennedy&#x2019;s presidency to explore how his legacy has affected every president since, particularly Lyndon Johnson and Ronald Reagan. Most important, Sabato relies on &#x201c;cutting-edge audio technology&#x201d; to debunk a key finding of a House committee in 1979 that an open microphone on a Dallas police officer&#x2019;s motorcycle picked up the sound of a fourth shot &#x2015; suggesting the involvement of a second shooter.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>The Columbus Dispatch</i></p><p>&#x201c;A timely, well-documented, and measured view of our 35th president.&#x201d; &#x2015;<i>Publishers Weekly</i></p></p><h2>The Lincolns: A Scrapbook Look at Abraham and Mary</h2><p>The&nbsp;award-winning author of <i>Ben Franklin&#x2019;s Almanac </i>and <i>Our Eleanor </i>has created an enthralling joint biography of our greatest president, Abraham Lincoln, and his complex wife&#x2014;a scrapbook history that uses photographs, letters, engravings, and even cartoons, along with a fascinating text, to form an enthralling museum on the page. <i>The Lincolns</i> received four starred reviews and won the <i>Boston Globe&#x2013;Horn Book</i> Award for Non-Fiction, making this the perfect addition to any collection.<br><br>Here are the extraordinary lives of Abraham and Mary, from their disparate childhoods and tumultuous courtship, through the agony of the Civil War, to the loss of three of their children, and finally their own tragic deaths.

She lives in Oak Park, Illinois.Starred Review. Grade 6 Up&#x2014;What did this backwoods boy and this bluegrass girl have in common? Using her signature scrapbook approach, Fleming lays out the answer in a biography that gives equal emphasis to Abraham and Mary Lincoln for an insightful portrait of their lives. Her scholarship over five years pays off with a rich account that is personal and concrete. She recounts Mary's early life as a privileged&#x2014;but motherless&#x2014;child, her ambitions for her husband, and her role as "first lady" (a term originally coined for her). Large and small details are juxtaposed with specifics about Lincoln and broadened by Mary's significance. For example, a political decision was made regarding her attendance at the debates; Lincoln wanted to preserve his "common man" image rather than show off his refined and educated wife. Unlike most biographies, which conclude with Lincoln's death, this one follows Mary's story to the end, detailing Robert Todd's role in her commitment to an insane asylum, Tad's death, and her own demise. Presented in period typefaces, the boxed bits of text, sidebars, and numerous running heads and subheads add detail. From portraits to pets, the book contains a wide variety of graphics, including written and visual primary documents that enrich every spread. Notes, resources, and source notes are exemplary. It's hard to imagine a more engaging or well-told biography of the Lincolns.&#x2014;<i>Janet S.

In the haute-bohemian circles of Austria, Germany, and Paris, Hitler is circulating a most-wanted list of &#x201c;cultural degenerates&#x201d;&#x2015;artists, writers, and thinkers whose work is deemed antithetical to the new regime.&nbsp; To prevent the destruction of her favorite art (and artists), the impetuous American heiress and modern art collector, Leonora Calaway, begins chartering boats and planes for an elite group of surrealists to Costalegre, a mysterious resort in the Mexican jungle, where she has a home.&nbsp;</p><p>The story of what happens to these artists when they reach their destination is told from the point of view of Lara, Leonora&#x2019;s neglected 15-year-old daughter, who has been pulled out of school to follow her mother to Mexico.

Through a well-reasoned and logical process, Polkinghorne argues that reality consists not only of the scientific processes of the natural world but also the personal dimension of human nature and its significance. He offers an integrated view of reality, encompassing a range of insights deriving from physics&#x2019; account of causal structure, evolutionary understanding of human nature, the unique significance of Jesus of Nazareth, and the human encounter with God.<br><br> The author devotes further chapters to specific problems and questions raised by the Christian account of divine reality. He discusses, for example, the nature of time and God&#x2019;s relation to it, the interrelationship of the world&#x2019;s faiths, the problem of evil, and practical ethical issues relating to genetic advances, including stem cell research. Continuing in his pursuit of a dialogue between science and theology that accords equal weight to the insights of each, Polkinghorne expands our understanding of the nature of reality and our appreciation of its complexity.</p><p><p><b>John Polkinghorne, KBE, FRS, </b>is fellow and retired president of Queens&#x2019; College, Cambridge. Winner of the 2002 Templeton Prize, he is both a quantum physicist and an Anglican priest.</p>Starred Review. According to the physicist-priest Polkinghorne, "If the physicists seem to achieve their ends more successfully than the theologians, that is simply a reflection of how much easier science is than theology." Without abandoning his general standpoint as both a scientist and a theologian, Polkinghorne's essays pursue a wider set of interests, acknowledging terrain where theology becomes difficult and uncertain work. Reflections on issues of space-time, quantum mechanics and chaos theory&#x2014;familiar from Polkinghorne's previous books&#x2014;are joined by essays on human nature, the problem of evil, the historical Jesus and the relationship between Christianity and other faiths. Polkinghorne's basic approach remains consistent: he is a friend of science, but a foe of scientific reductionism, arguing that "nothing [science] can tell us requires us to deny our directly experienced human capacity" to act responsibly and seek meaning in the universe. Surveying human aptitudes for self-consciousness, language, rationality, creativity, moral awareness and the "slantedness" of human life that theologians call sin, Polkinghorne concludes, "how strange it is that many biologists... claim not to be able so see anything really distinctive about <i>Homo sapiens</i>." Balancing intellectual modesty with openness about his own Christian faith, Polkinghorne's reflections will engage both thoughtful believers and inquirers into issues of faith and reason. <i>(Nov. 29)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

The mole genius has left us with another digest. It's a full house&#x2014;read 'em and weep."&#x2014;Tom Waits <p>After toiling in obscurity for years, Charles Bukowski suddenly found fame in 1967 with his autobiographical newspaper column, "Notes of a Dirty Old Man," and a book of that name in 1969. He continued writing this column, in one form or another, through the mid-1980s. <em>More Notes of a Dirty Old Man</em> gathers many uncollected gems from the column's twenty-year run. Drawn from ephemeral underground publications, these stories and essays haven't been seen in decades, making <em>More</em> a valuable addition to Bukowski's oeuvre. Filled with his usual obsessions&#x2014;sex, booze, gambling&#x2014;<em>More</em> features Bukowski's offbeat insights into politics and literature, his tortured, violent relationships with women, and his lurid escapades on the poetry reading circuit. Highlighting his versatility, the book ranges from thinly veiled autobiography to purely fictional tales of dysfunctional suburbanites, disgraced politicians, and down-and-out sports promoters, climaxing with a long, hilarious adventure among French filmmakers, "My Friend the Gambler," based on his experiences making the movie <em>Barfly</em>. From his lowly days at the post office through his later literary fame, <em>More</em> follows the entire arc of Bukowski's colorful career.</p><p>Edited by Bukowski scholar David Stephen Calonne, <em>More Notes of a Dirty Old Man</em> features an afterword outlining the history of the column and its effect on the author's creative development.</p><p>Born in Andernach, Germany in 1920, <strong>Charles Bukowski</strong> came to California at age three and spent most of his life in Los Angeles.

He presently teaches at East Michigan University.<br><br>Author of over 50 books, <strong>Charles Bukowski</strong> (1920-1994) was born in Germany but spent most of his life in Los Angeles, with which he is closely identified. His outrageous tales of sex, booze, and gambling remain wildly popular today."In another installment of his essays and ramblings, City Lights press have surely come up with a winner."&#x2014;<em>Beat Scene</em><br><br>"Proving that misanthropic and humanitarian are two sides of the same tarnished coin and that stagnation and metamorphosis are equally related, this collection arcs subtly from the banal side of addiction to the most extreme forms of love and hate. Bukowski's prose is still relevant, still shocking, still transcendent."&#x2014;<em>Publishers Weekly</em><br><br>"To anyone familiar with Bukowski's work, they're more of the good stuff -- essays on pure desire that demonstrate his lust for the physical world. And of course, they're shot through with Bukowski's admirable denial of a higher meaning to his work -- to an earnest interviewer, he writes, 'When I die they can take my work and wipe a cat's ass with it. It will be of no earthly use to me.'"&#x2014;<em>LA Weekly</em><br><br>"In these pieces, written for the alternative press from 1967 through the mid-&#x2019;80s, is a Bukowski you might not know&#x2014;the father taking his seven-year-old daughter to the beach in Santa Monica, where he rescues a homeless man who&#x2019;s been beaten up by thugs. Here's the Bukowski lost in the gender wars, confused and trying to keep his own desire (piggy at times, yes) alive. He wasn't looking for beauty, but he found it now and then. And he was happy writing these columns&#x2014;as much as a grumpy middle-aged drunk can be."&#x2014;Susan Salter Reynolds, <em>Los Angeles Magazine</em><br><br>"He's been gone since 1994, but Charles Bukowski continues to fascinate us. His tales of sex, drugs,and booze, and more sex, drugs, and booze, ad infinitum, resonate a lurid energy that grabs our attention and keeps it."&#x2014;<em>SF Weekly</em></p><h2>Inside the Miracle: Enduring Suffering, Approaching Wholeness</h2><p><p>Many are familiar with teacher and poet Mark Nepo's books on inner transformation, relationship, and the emergence of purpose in our lives. But less well-known is the journey that shaped his vision as a teacher<br> that began in 1987 when he was diagnosed with cancer. The revelations during that time would inform every dimension of his work to follow.</p><p> With Inside the Miracle, Mark Nepo shares what he discovered along this challenging terrain, and the insights most essential to those of us who now find ourselves there. The lessons and stories here are for<br> all of us, ill or not, when the inevitable question arises: How do we move through an overwhelming crisis&#x2015;whether from physical illness, grief, or a major life change&#x2015;into the rest of our lives?</p><p> This offering presents in its entirety Nepo's 1994 literary gem Acre of Light, written shortly after his recovery. Here, he expands and enriches its themes with new poems, essays, and teachings gathered in the<br> decades since. Throughout, Mark includes compelling questions and exercises from his popular workshops, to invite us to personalize the experience.</p><p> What emerges is a reading companion to be explored in many ways: as a memoir, as a "survival kit" of wisdom and verse that helped Mark during his own journey, and as a conversation to spark our own<br> contemplation, journaling, and discovery.</p><p> "To live in wonder on the other side of suffering and disappointment," reflects Mark Nepo, "is to know how magnificent and fragile it is to be here at all." Inside the Miracle calls us to leap into our lives with tenderness and courage, so we can fully inhabit the miraculous moments that await us.</p></p><p><p><b>Mark Nepo</b><br><b>Mark Nepo</b> is a poet and philosopher who has taught in the fields of poetry and spirituality for over 35 years.

He suggests that people welcome adversity in order to move through it and provides remnants, such as poems and journal excerpts, from his own experience as well as "questions to walk with" directed at readers facing their own struggles. VERDICT Amazingly honest and inspiring for those confronting serious illness or dramatic transitions. While Nepo writes with academic references, his message is for everyone.&#x201d; &#x2015;Library Journal, starred review</p><p>&#x201c;Nepo was in his thirties when he was diagnosed with cancer and his life changed all the way through to its core. He speaks of his transformation with eloquent insight. Three decades after his illness, he&#x2019;s still garnering the lessons that came buried in that experience. Practically, it&#x2019;s become his life&#x2019;s work. This book, which draws on journal entries made during and since his illness, contains a collection of poems and prose that grew out of his experience with cancer and its aftermath. He speaks of the touchstone of grace, the current of life, embracing the will to live, the raw truth of my journey, the inner rhythm of healing, and enduring the miracle. Let customers know that while this is a straightforward discussion of his struggle with cancer, it remains uplifting and strangely lyrical throughout.

But can she enlist his aid in helping her stop a killer who&#x2019;s already claimed the lives&#x2014;and souls&#x2014;of thirteen people? And should she?

I made a frantic grasp at the portal, cold sweat breaking out under my arms as I struggled to wrench the power back into place. My heart slammed in my chest as I fought the uncontrolled energy, seizing each strand to bind and anchor it. My technique was raw and inelegant, but I didn't give a crap. I was only interested in surviving, not in how pretty it looked.<br><br>It felt like an eternity, but it was merely several frenzied seconds before I had the wildly fluctuating potencies settled and calmed. I cautiously loosened my hold as I took several deep, ragged breaths, struggling to slow the mad galloping of my pulse. That had been far too close for my peace of mind. If that loss of focus had come just a few -seconds earlier, I most likely would have been ripped apart&#x2014;either by the maelstrom of the arcane portal I'd opened in the basement of my house or by the claws of the demon I'd just summoned through that portal.<br><br>I exhaled a shuddering breath, finally releasing my hold on the portal as I looked with no small amount of triumph at the massive demon on one knee before me, his head lowered and his wings tucked along his back. He had remained utterly still throughout my battle with the portal, and I silently thanked whatever powers existed that I had already sealed the terms with him before losing control. I could feel a grin spread across my face. I'd done it. I had summoned a reyza, the highest of the twelve levels of demons.<br><br>I was officially a -full&#x2014;fledged summoner.<br><br>The sharp crack of more glass breaking spoiled my reverie. My grin shifted to a scowl. A burglar. Just great. If I went upstairs to deal with the idiot, I would have to abandon my ulterior motive for summoning the demon. And summoning a reyza was worth more than a few wordly possessions. Besides, my wordly possessions weren't worth very much.<br><br>But the demon snapped his head up at the sound. "Some-one intrudes on your demesne," he growled, deep voice res-onating powerfully through the basement. Before I could take a breath to give a response or command, the demon bounded up the heavy wooden stairs of my basement, bursting through the door that exited into the main hallway of my house.<br><br>"Son of a bitch!" I swiftly anchored the potency that I hadn't yet grounded. Well, so much for that plan. My legs shook as I staggered up the stairs after the demon, and I snarled at the fatigue that slowed me down. I was used to feeling somewhat drained after a summoning, but this was more than I'd expected.<br><br>I heard a panicked shriek coming from the front of my house and I took off in that direction, forcing my wobbly legs to move. Okay, I managed to summon him. Now can I control him? The shriek of terror abruptly spiraled upward as I lurched down the hall.<br><br>"Kehlirik! No harm!" I shouted, commanding the demon with my voice even as I exerted mental pressure on the arcane bindings.<br><br>I rounded the corner to the living room, panting for breath and grateful that my house was "cozy" instead of palatial. I wasn't sure if I could have made it much farther without falling on my face. I made a quick mental note: Get more rest before summoning a -twelfth&#x2014;level demon!<br><br>The demon snarled and turned to me, holding a -rail&#x2014;thin, gibbering man by the collar and looking insanely incongruous against the muted -sage&#x2014;green walls and cherrywood furniture in my living room. One wingtip brushed the computer on my desk, and I resisted the urge to grab that wing and yank him away. Probably not a good idea when I still wasn't certain if the demon would abide by my will.<br><br>"You should let me slay him, summoner," the demon said in a deep voice that sounded like rolling boulders. He held his captive dangling above the floor with no apparent effort and no strain showing in his heavily muscled body. He towered over me, his head topping mine by several feet, with leathery wings the color of burnished copper extending several more feet beyond that. In a house with -eight&#x2014;foot ceilings, the demon would have been forced to crouch awkwardly and tuck in his wings in order to fit. For-tunately for him, my -Acadian&#x2014;style house had the traditional -fifteen&#x2014;foot ceilings designed for the subtropical climate of south Louisiana, where high ceilings helped keep houses cool.<br><br>I took a deep, steadying breath. The demon wasn't resisting my control. One less thing to sweat right now. "No, Kehlirik," I said carefully. "Our justice works differently in this sphere. But I thank you for your aid." The demon's captive had ceased his shrieking, at least, now reduced to whimpering moans. I rubbed the sudden gooseflesh on my arms, still horribly unnerved at how close I'd come to disaster. Just a few seconds earlier . . . I threw off a shudder and forced my attention back to the present.<br><br>A throbbing growl came from the demon's throat. "He is a thief. Worthless. He has no honor." He crouched and dropped the man to the floor, then pinned the intruder down with one foot. He tucked his wings behind him, clasping wickedly clawed hands together in front of him. A thick, sinuous tail curled around his legs, tip twitching in indication of his mood, and a dark and spicy scent surrounded him, foreign and wild. Crouched, his head was level with mine, and I was relieved that I could stop craning my neck to speak to him. This was only the second reyza I had ever seen, and I was still shocked at how large they were.<br><br>"It is . . . different here," I said, even though I heartily agreed with the demon's assessment of his captive. "I'm going to have enough trouble explaining away his talk of winged monsters."<br><br>"If I slay him, he cannot speak of winged monsters," Kehlirik replied, with undeniable logic. Then his broad nostrils flared as he snorted, "Not that I am a monster."<br><br>I had to smile. "No, reyza. You are no monster." Though the demon was monstrous in appearance&#x2014;flat nose set in a bestial face, a wide mouth accented with curved fangs, and a thick ridge crest that swept back over his head and down his spine&#x2014;I knew far too well that he was anything but a monster. "But it would be more difficult to explain a dead body," I continued. "Murder is a serious offense here."<br><br>He bared his teeth, lips curling back from the wicked fangs. "No body would be found, summoner. But I will respect your desire." He inclined his head to me, then spread his wings, somehow managing not to knock any of my pictures off the shelves. I looked at him in uninhibited delight. I'd spent almost ten years studying and training, carefully guided by my mentor and aunt through the summoning rituals of each level of demon, gradually working my way up to working solo. A solo summoning of a reyza was considered "graduation," and here I was with one in my living room.<br><br>I crouched to get a look at the -wide&#x2014;eyed man beneath Kehlirik's foot, unconsciously echoing the demon's posture. Pale and skinny with scraggly hair that stood out from his head, the intruder was probably in his early to mid thirties, though I knew that my estimate could be off by about a decade. Heavy drug use tended to age a person, and I could easily peg him as a meth or possibly crack user. He also had the distinct sour odor of someone who hadn't paid close attention to hygiene for quite some time, and I found myself shifting slightly closer to the reyza, whose scent was far more appealing.<br><br>"Wow, did you ever pick the wrong house tonight," I said. Then I had to laugh as a realization hit me. "Wait. I bet you're the one who broke into those two houses up the highway last week. Am I right?"<br><br>The man whimpered and shook his head, his eyes wild. "No! No, not me! I . . . I thought this was my buddy's house&#x2014;"<br><br>Kehlirik snarled down at the man, causing him to yelp in terror again. "I'm not stupid," I informed my intruder. "Don't insult me again."<br><br>The man began to shake with sobs. "OhGodohGod, pplease don't let it eat me! I'll never do it again, I swear. I just needed enough to buy a rock. Oh, God!"<br><br>I shifted my regard to the demon. Kehlirik rumbled low in his throat, returning my gaze with eyes full of intelligence and cunning. I was ridiculously tempted to screw with my burglar and ask the demon if he was hungry, but I wasn't completely sure that Kehlirik would realize I was kidding. I was fairly positive that demons had no taste for human flesh, but it was probably best to not test the issue. There were plenty of unknowns when it came to demons.<br><br>I stood, shaking a slight cramp out of my leg. I really couldn't allow the demon to kill him. The guy was a drug addict and probably had a rap sheet a mile long, but I doubted that any of his offenses were of the capital variety&#x2014;most likely nothing more than theft to support his habit. Besides, I was supposed to be one of the good guys.<br><br>Oh, well. There was no doubt that he was going to babble about what he saw. I would just have to trust that no one would believe any ravings he might have about winged monsters.<br><br>Besides, it was his own damn fault that he'd picked my house to break into, on a night that I'd summoned a demon.<br><br>A deliciously wicked compromise occurred to me. "Reyza, I do not wish this one slain, but perhaps you could do me a service."<br><br>The demon's eyes glowed a ruddy orange in the dim light of my living room. "Name your desire, summoner."<br><br>With effort, I kept my face composed. "I would have him punished for his intrusion, yet he must be returned to me physically unharmed."<br><br>The demon inclined his head gravely, but I was fairly sure I could see amusement in his eyes. "It will be done, summoner."<br><br>I barely had time to step out of the demon's way before he snatched up the pathetic man and bounded out the front door. I followed, pausing just long enough to grab my cell phone and handcuffs off my desk. I exited onto my porch just in time to see Kehlirik leap into the air with my erstwhile intruder firmly grasped in clawed hands.<br><br>I let out a snicker and sat on the front step. I listened as the panicked screams faded into the night sky, then dialed the number for the St. Long Parish Sheriff's Office.<br><br>"Hi, this is Detective Kara Gillian with the PD," I said when the dispatcher answered. "Could you please send a patrol unit to my home address? I have a -ten&#x2014;fifteen on a 62R here." A -10&#x2014;15 was an arrest, and a 62R was a burglary. Though I worked for the Beaulac Police Department, I lived outside the city limits, which meant that if something criminal happened at my house, it was sheriff's office jurisdiction.<br><br>"A 62R . . . Kara, someone broke into your house? Way out there?"<br><br>I recognized the woman's voice as a dispatcher who'd previously worked with the PD. Slightly pudgy with harshly dyed red hair, but I couldn't remember the woman's name to save my life. "Yeah, but all he managed to do was break a window by the door."<br><br>The dispatcher laughed. "Bad choice of houses!"<br><br>You have no idea, I thought. "No kidding," I said instead. "Good thing the noise woke me up."<br><br>"All right, I'll get a unit out there."<br><br>I set the phone down and clasped my hands lightly around my knees, looking up at the moon that shone full through the barest sheen of clouds. A languid breeze twined through the dark trees, rustling needles and bringing a deep, rich scent of earth and pine to me. I hugged myself against the slight chill, listening to the faint buzz of a mosquito and the song of a nearby cricket. A satisfied peace stole through me, an -almost&#x2014;Pavlovian response to my environment. I'd lived in this house my entire life&#x2014;with the exception of one terrible month after my father was killed by a drunk driver. I was eleven and had been placed in foster care until my aunt Tessa could return from Japan to take over as my legal guardian. My mother had passed away three years before that, from ovarian cancer that had gone undetected until it was far too late, and there were no other relatives&#x2014;or even close friends&#x2014;to take me in, a fact that had not pleased my aunt at the time, especially since the one time she'd met me before I'd been in diapers. But she'd done what she could to lessen the upheaval for me, despite her reluctance to take on the enormous responsibility of raising a preteen kid. She'd moved into this house with me instead of yanking me out of the only home I'd ever known, knowing that in time I would find more comfort than grief here.<br><br>I was nearly thirty now and finally beginning to realize just how important that comfort was to me. I loved it out here, far from town and other houses. I lived on a -seldom&#x2014;traveled highway, my driveway was long and winding, and the nearest neighbor was well over a mile away.<br><br>It was the perfect house for someone who required privacy.<br><br>And it wasn't until I was fifteen that I'd learned my aunt's ulterior motive for the decision to raise me in this house. My aunt Tessa was a summoner of demons, and the basement of this house was an ideal place for a summoning chamber.<br><br>A few minutes later, the demon swooped down to land neatly in front of me, dangling his -ashen&#x2014;faced prisoner by one ankle. "I believe he is suitably cowed."<br><br>Too bad I couldn't give this treatment to all my arrestees. We'd probably have fewer repeat offenders, I thought as I handcuffed the unresisting man. I left him whimpering softly on the porch with his hands cuffed behind his back, then returned my attention to the demon. "My thanks again, Kehlirik."<br><br>The demon slowly sank into a crouch. "Summoner, this was the first time you called a reyza unaided, yes?"<br><br>I gave a wary nod. Had I screwed something up?<br><br>He snorted, flaring his nostrils. "I did not think that you called me for the sole purpose of thwarting an intrusion. Had you another desire for this summoning?"</p><h2>Daughters of Kerala: 25 Short Stories by Award-Winning Authors</h2><p><p>Kerala, one of the smallest states in India, is located in the country's southwest corner.

More than just an exploration of the use of the ancient rhetorical tools and devices, this guide introduces the reader to all that went into convincing an audience about some subject. Witherington makes the case that rhetorical criticism is a more fruitful approach to the NT epistles than the oft-employed approaches of literary and discourse criticism. Familiarity with the art of rhetoric also helps the reader explore non-epistolary genres. In addition to the general introduction to rhetorical criticism, the book guides readers through the many and varied uses of rhetoric in most NT documents-not only telling readers about rhetoric in the NT, but showing them the way it was employed.&#34;This brief guide book is intended to provide the reader with an entrance into understanding the rhetorical analysis of various parts of the NT, the value such studies bring for understanding what is being proclaimed and defended in the NT, and how Christ is presented in ways that would be considered persuasive in antiquity.&#34; - from the introduction</p><p></p><h2>Our Political Nature: The Evolutionary Origins of What Divides Us</h2><p>The first book to tell the natural history of political orientations.Our Political Natureis the first book to reveal the hidden roots of our most deeply held moral values. It shows how political orientations across space and time arise from three clusters of measurable personality traits. These clusters entail opposing attitudes toward tribalism, inequality, and differing perceptions of human nature. Together, these traits are by far the most powerful cause of left-right voting, even leading people to regularly vote against their economic interests.As this book explains, our political personalities also influence our likely choice of a mate, and shape society&#39;s larger reproductive patterns. Most importantly of all, it tells the evolutionary stories of these crucial personality traits, which stem from epic biological conflicts.Based on dozens of exciting new insights from primatology, genetics, neuroscience, and anthropology, this groundbreaking work brings core concepts to life through current news stories and personalities. For instance, readers will meet Glenn Beck and Hugo Chavez and come to understand the underlying evolutionary forces they represent. By blending serious research with relevant contemporary examples,Our Political Naturecasts important light onto the ideological clashes that so dangerously divide and imperil our world today.</p><p><b>Avi Tuschman</b>&nbsp;is an internationally recognized expert on heritable psychometric traits.

On some level they acknowledge that humans are social primates with a particular evolutionary heritage, but if you drill far enough down into their personal preferences &#x2014; Why do you have a sweet tooth? Why do you vote a certain way? &#x2014; their explanations usually veer into self-determination. They like sugar or vote Republican because they choose to &#x2014; it&#x2019;s what makes them, <i>them</i>. Given how natural selection works, it&#x2019;s entirely possible that an aversion to evolutionary explanations is <i>in itself</i> a product of evolution. In a hostile environment, wouldn&#x2019;t a belief in self-determination be adaptive regardless of whether it were true? But no matter, the point is that anti-evolutionary bias makes rational discussion of the human race far more difficult.<br><br>Interestingly, this particular bias is prevalent at <i>both</i> ends of the political spectrum, for entirely different reasons. Cultural conservatives often reject the theory of evolution because it elbows aside the proposition that God created humans in His own image (and that idea risks being the thin end of the wedge for a broader argument that there is no God at all, and that the universe &#x2014; and all life within it &#x2014; is just a massive laboratory experiment). Secular liberals, on the other hand, have a different agenda. They are comfortable with a godless universe but balk at the prospect of living in a society that is deeply influenced by biological realities. Worldwide phenomena such as aggression, warfare, and other gender differences are ascribed to culture &#x2014; rather than genetics or biology &#x2014; because to do otherwise would be to give up, as it were, on the struggle for social justice. A 2019 report by the American Psychological Association, for example, made the startling claim that virtually all gender difference is culturally imposed &#x2014; ignoring, among other things, the profound effect testosterone has on behavior.<br><br>But many such progressives who reject biological differences between the sexes happily watch Olympic competitions that carefully separate women from men so that testosterone differentials do not result in men sweeping every contest except, perhaps, the equestrian events. Equally puzzling, cultural conservatives who reject any biological explanation of human origins are happy to take medicine that works biologically to treat their illnesses and alleviate their suffering. Perhaps the best explanation for such irrationality is that irrationality itself is adaptive if it binds people together into like-minded groups.<br><br>Given these sensitivities, the most inflammatory proposition of all may be that our political views are substantially influenced by genetics. No other proposition so exquisitely combines the logical blind spots of both liberals and conservatives with the cauldron of political passion that bubbles within all of us. Politics is an emotional topic because people feel they have arrived at their conclusions through deep moral reasoning. It&#x2019;s not just a collection of policy opinions and problem-solving strategies; it&#x2019;s a core philosophy that goes straight to a person&#x2019;s identity. And because moral reasoning feels both noble and incontrovertible, few people want to be told that these sacred conclusions are profoundly influenced by genetics.&nbsp;<br><br>The effect of genetics is so strong, however, that according to empirical studies, identical twins who are raised apart are more likely to hold similar political views than fraternal twins who are raised together. Between 40 and 60 percent of the variance in our political attitudes is heritable, stemming from genetic differences between individuals; the rest comes from our environment, including the people and events we were exposed to during our formative years. Political opinion also relates to brain structure: an experiment measuring the sizes of the anterior cingulate and the right amygdala accurately predicted a person&#x2019;s political orientation 72 percent of the time. Some of these political proclivities appear to be connected to Chromosome 4 in a neurotransmitter receptor called NARG1.<br><br>The fact that political opinion is rooted in our genes and biology means that both liberalism and conservatism are adaptive traits that got passed down through thousands of human generations because they helped us survive. But another trait that is clearly adaptive is our ability to get along. Political arguments may rage within families, communities, and even nations, yet they rarely threaten the cohesion of the group. On some level, humans seem to understand that differences of opinion are unpleasant, but splitting up may be even <i>more</i> unpleasant &#x2014; or downright dangerous. Humans don&#x2019;t survive alone in nature, they die, and the larger our core group, the safer we are.<br><br>At this moment in America, many people are concerned that the country is splitting apart along ideological lines. With no credible enemy to encourage unity, the country finds itself in a deep political argument where both liberals and conservatives accuse the other of not only being wrong, but actually a threat to the country. The <i>real</i> threat to the country, of course, is bellicose, divisive rhetoric. But this is where the theory of evolution might throw Americans a lifeline.<br><br>If liberalism and conservatism are partly rooted in genetics, then those worldviews <i>had</i> to have been adaptive &#x2014; and necessary &#x2014; in our evolutionary past. That means that neither political party can accuse the other of being illegitimate or inherently immoral; we are the way we are for good reason. Every human society must do two things: It must be strong enough to protect itself from outside groups, and it must be fair enough to avoid internal conflict. A society composed entirely of liberals risks being overrun by enemies, and a society composed entirely of conservatives risks breaking apart over issues of inequality &#x2014; &#x201c;social justice,&#x201d; as it&#x2019;s now termed.<br><br>Put those groups together, however, and you have addressed the two greatest threats to human welfare: enemies, and discord. The task for every society, from the earliest <i>Homo sapiens</i> of Africa to Americans of the twenty-first century, is to accommodate different values and worldviews into one central ethos. It&#x2019;s not easy to do, but our own genetic diversity clearly demonstrates that it&#x2019;s possible. Otherwise, one set of values would have gradually dominated the other until there was no political discord at all; just a broad, flat uniformity. That may sound appealing at the moment. But in the long term, what a great loss that would be.<br><br>--Sebastian Junger, author of <i>Tribe</i></p><h2>Paris In Mind: From Mark Twain to Langston Hughes, from Saul Bellow to David Sedaris: Three Centuries of Americans Writing About Their Romance (and Frustrations) with Paris</h2><p>&#x201c;Paris is a moveable feast,&#x201d; Ernest Hemingway famously wrote, and in this captivating anthology, American writers share their pleasures, obsessions, and quibbles with the great city and its denizens.

Americans have been heeding the maxim for more than three centuries, from Benjamin Franklin, Mark Twain, Ana�s Nin to Dave Barry and David Sedaris, all of them collected here. Many of us cheat and get there a little before we&#x2019;ve actually earned it. <br><br>I first saw Paris when I was twelve years old and on a chaperoned school tour of the great (read: <i>old</i>) cities of Europe. Paris felt like a respite from Europe&#x2019;s ancient ruins. In Paris, we kids went gallivanting in parks, checked out bookstalls near the Seine, ate too many pastries and tried to pass as older than we were. We snuck out of our hotel at four in the morning and walked to the Eiffel Tower unchaperoned. The city was still and quiet, and we could hear the crunch of dirt and gravel beneath our feet. We felt powerful to be alone, except for the few elderly people walking their tiny French dogs or feeding the city&#x2019;s many pigeons. <br><br>I realize now that my youthful excitement didn&#x2019;t just come from being in a beautiful city. Racing like wild children along the banks of the Seine, or weaving through a crowd of people on the Champs �lys�es, discovering more bookstores than I&#x2019;d ever seen in my twelve-year old lifetime and watching adults sitting and talking in caf�s, I sensed then that there was a way of life different than the one I knew back in my dusty, rural California hometown. <br><br>The second time I saw Paris, I was in love. We had flown to Paris on a whim. Paris felt like a respite from the daily grind. We strolled along the Seine, ate too many pastries and behaved more youthful than our age. M.F.K. Fisher in her book, <b>The Gastronomical Me</b><i>,</i> advises that Paris &#x201c;should always be seen, the first time, with the eyes of childhood or of love.&#x201d; We&#x2019;re especially lucky if we&#x2019;ve seen Paris both ways. <br>So seductive is the idea of Paris in America that even those who have never set foot in the city fall in love with it. You don&#x2019;t even have to be a Francophile. Paris is one of the few cities in the world that defines an entire country, yet stands singular and apart from it. To some, their love for Paris is part of a broader love of all things French. To others, it&#x2019;s discrete. They love Paris and only Paris. <br><br>Gertrude Stein believed that when we talked about France, we were really talking about Paris. That was when she wrote, &#x201c;Paris was where the twentieth century was.&#x201d; She was writing not so much about political power or technological progress, but of contributions in the arts and in the things more loosely called civilization, the art of living well. It was perhaps more true in the early twentieth century than it is today. Today, art, literature, culture and fashion are no longer the sole domains of haute Paris, and Paris is no longer the only French destination for Americans and other travelers. When people talk about Paris, it&#x2019;s no longer a given that we mean France in general and vice versa. Yet to so many, by the power of imagination or myth, Paris remains <i>sui generis, </i>and the most seductive of cities. <br><br>How seductive is Paris? <br><br>So seductive is it that God is seduced in Saul Bellow&#x2019;s essay <i>My Paris. </i>Bellow writes, &#x201c;God would be perfectly happy in France because he would not be troubled by prayers, observances, blessings and demands for the interpretation of difficult dietary questions. Surrounded by unbelievers He too could relax toward evening, just as thousands of Parisians do at their favorite caf�s.&#x201d; <br><br>So seductive is Paris that long after one&#x2019;s affair in Paris has ended, many continue their affairs with the city itself. <br><br>So seductive is Paris that even its winters can&#x2019;t hide its charms for long. Irwin Shaw laments the cold season as he writes in <b>Paris in Winter</b><i>,</i> &#x201c;The most openly loving of cities, it is the coldest when the lovers are driven indoors. [In Paris] it is impossible to overlook the unheroic fact that not enough people kiss in the rain or at five degrees below zero.&#x201d; Shaw describes the anti-Paris in winter, and still, he can&#x2019;t help being captivated all over again when the sun comes out for the briefest of moments. <br><br>Much of the seduction comes from the long history of U.S.-French relationship: we revolt against the British&#x2014;the French give us ships and money; they&#x2019;re occupied by the Germans&#x2014;we invade Normandy and liberate them; they invent film&#x2014;we make an industry out of it; we make B action flicks&#x2014;they name it &#x201c;film noir&#x201d;; they&#x2019;re crazy about Jerry Lewis&#x2014;we fall in love with Catherine Deneuve. They gave us the most American of American icons, the Statue of Liberty. The Americans and French have held a political, cultural, economic and artistic dialog for more than three centuries. In many ways, we&#x2014;Americans and Parisians&#x2014;are both our best and worst reflections. <br><br>The stories about Paris that I read as a teenager made at least as big an impression as my first visit to the city. In general, Paris isn&#x2019;t a city for twelve-year-olds the way some cities are&#x2014;cities like, say, Orlando, Florida&#x2014;even now, despite Euro Disney. The first book about Paris that I read was Ernest Hemingway&#x2019;s <b>A Moveable Feast</b><i>,</i> and I haven&#x2019;t yet outgrown the love it first inspired for the City of Light. Reading about grown-up Parisian adventures revealed future possibilities for this restless teenager, and it made me aspire to see Paris as a grown up. <br><br>I suspect many Francophiles have a similarly worn and beloved book about Paris. Without a doubt, the American artists, writers and musicians who went to Paris have influenced much of our fascination and love for this city. It is they who inspired this collection in that they first sparked my love of Paris. <br><br>I&#x2019;m not alone in my fondness for the City of Light. Travel between the U.S. and France has always been strong. Americans still comprise the largest group of tourists to Paris annually despite the significant decrease immediately following September 11, 2001, and the Travel Industry Association of America expects air travel to return to normal levels by late 2004 or 2005. The history of travel between Americans and the French, which spans centuries, not decades, attest to our mutual strange fascination with each other. <br><br>One of the legacies of this long relationship has been great American literature about Paris and about being an American in Paris.<br>A few words about how this book was put together and what you&#x2019;ll find here: though I searched far and wide to collect the pieces in <b>Paris in Mind</b><i>, </i>I also relied on the familiar literature on Paris. This is not a collection of unknown, never-before-seen Paris dispatches, and you&#x2019;ll find some familiar suspects such as Ernest Hemingway, Gertrude Stein and Thomas Jefferson. Some Americans have been so important to the way we imagine Paris, that without them no Paris collection could offer a full sense of Franco-American relationship. <br><br>Secondly, many pieces are presented here, but many more have been left out for editorial or practical reasons. As an editor, I naturally wanted to read everything that I found, that was recommended, or that simply came my way; I wanted readers to have a chance to read everything I read, too. As a fellow <i>reader,</i> however, the process of editorial research wasn&#x2019;t the reading experience I&#x2019;d wish to inflict on innocent readers, simply because not everything you read turns out to be a find.<br><br>Lastly, I followed two goals for this collection: pleasure and variety. A selected piece had to be a pleasure to read or offer a perspective, or examine a topic, that testified to the breadth of American interests and experiences in Paris. This is, admittedly, a subjective process. In general, I found that people for whom writing was their vocation wrote more vividly and thoughtfully about their experiences in Paris than those whose lives didn&#x2019;t depend on their prose. So, the book includes pieces that are almost all authored by professional writers, rather than by celebrities, musicians, politicos and so forth. <br><br>In some cases, I included pieces that played off of other selections and thus, provide a sense of dialog between eras or between writers. The two pieces by Edith Wharton (an excerpt from <b>A Backward Glance</b>) and E.B. White (<b>Liberation of Paris</b>)<i> </i>are good examples. They&#x2019;re both about Paris and the end of a war, for Wharton the First World War and for White the Second World War: two different wars and writers, but the same overwhelming sense of emotion surfaces when each writer learns that the city they love so much is out of danger. <br><br>T.S. Eliot&#x2019;s and Ana�s Nin&#x2019;s pieces are another example. In his letter to the American poet, Robert McAlmon, Eliot admires French literary tradition because of its overarching sense of history, whereas Nin in her diary complains, &#x201c;There is a monster in Paris called the Literary Tradition.&#x201d; Eliot is the scholar and great critic, while Nin the mystic and bohemian. Two American writers with different opinions about French literature reveal vastly differing sensibilities about life. In turn, they give away diverging approaches to their own literary work. <br>A friend asked: <i>If I read this book, will I quit my job and move to Paris?</i> Will I hate the French for being better at everything, and skinnier? Will I finally be convinced that frog tastes just like chicken? Will I understand myself better as an American? <br><br>If you&#x2019;ve picked up this book, you might be someone who has already once quit his or her job and moved to Paris. You might be someone who already knows that frog doesn&#x2019;t taste just like chicken, it tastes <i>more like rabbit.</i> Just as likely, you might be someone who has never visited Paris except through movies, Cole Porter songs and the travel articles of your local Sunday paper. In any case, you probably already hate the French for being skinnier. We all do. This book won&#x2019;t really change that because&#x2014;bad news&#x2014;they&#x2019;re even thinner in Paris. <br>As for my friend&#x2019;s question, Will I understand myself better as an American? I hope so. These American stories about Paris comprise a catalog of tastes, fashions, social rules, and expectations, not only of what we think it is to be Parisian but also what we think it is to be American. <br><br>Finally, if you&#x2019;ve never been an American in Paris, I think you&#x2019;ll want to be. <br><br>If you already have been, you&#x2019;ll want to again. When M.F.K. Fisher wrote that Paris &#x201c;should always be seen, the first time, with the eyes of childhood or of love,&#x201d; she assumed we&#x2019;d see Paris again and again.</p><h2>The Absent City</h2><p>Widely acclaimed throughout Latin America after its 1992 release in Argentina, <i>The Absent City</i> takes the form of a futuristic detective novel. In the end, however, it is a meditation on the nature of totalitarian regimes, on the transition to democracy after the end of such regimes, and on the power of language to create and define reality. Ricardo Piglia combines his trademark avant-garde aesthetics with astute cultural and political insights into Argentina&#x2019;s history and contemporary condition in this conceptually daring and entertaining work.<br>The novel follows Junior, a reporter for a daily Buenos Aires newspaper, as he attempts to locate a secret machine that contains the mind and the memory of a woman named Elena. While Elena produces stories that reflect on actual events in Argentina, the police are seeking her destruction because of the revelations of atrocities that she&#x2014;the machine&#x2014;is disseminating through texts and taped recordings. The book thus portrays the race to recover the history and memory of a city and a country where history has largely been obliterated by political repression. Its narratives&#x2014;all part of a detective story, all part of something more&#x2014;multiply as they intersect with each other, like the streets and avenues of Buenos Aires itself. <br>The second of Piglia&#x2019;s novels to be translated by Duke University Press&#x2014;the first was <i>Artifical Respiration</i>&#x2014;this book continues the author&#x2019;s quest to portray the abuses and atrocities that characterize dictatorships as well as the difficulties associated with making the transition to democracy. Translated and with an introduction by Sergio Waisman, it includes a new afterword by the author.</p><p>&#x201c;Though clearly walking in the riverbank footsteps of the whimsical Macedonio and the noir geniuses Arlt and Onetti, Piglia is a genuine original, gifted with a fluid imagination that rushes past traditional narrative boundaries. The Absent City is a kind of mock thriller that lures its reader on, not with the question, &#x2018;What happens next?&#x2019; but with &#x2018;What was it that just happened?&#x2019; &#x201d;&#x2014;Robert Coover&#34;Piglia is Argentina&#39;s most important novelist, a compelling writer and committed intellectual who relentlessly deals with the complicated relationships between politics and fiction. And Sergio Waisman is an exceptionally gifted translator with a wonderful ear and eye for the reverberations of Spanish in English. &#34;The Absent City&#34; is a book for our times, one that transcends national boundaries.&#34;--Francine Masiello, author of &#34;Between Civilization and Barbarism: Women, Nation, and Literary Culture in Modern Argentina&#34;</p><h2>I Explain a Few Things: Selected Poems (English and Spanish Edition)</h2><p><p>"Laughter is the language of the soul," Pablo Neruda said. Among the most lasting voices of the most tumultuous (in his own words, "the saddest") century, a witness and a chronicler of its most decisive events, he is the author of more than thirty-five books of poetry and one of Latin America's most revered writers, the emblem of the engaged poet, an artist whose heart, always with the people, is literally consumed by passion. His work, oscillating from epic meditations on politics and history to intimate reflections on animals, food, and everyday objects, is filled with humor and affection.</p><p>This bilingual selection of more than fifty of Neruda's best poems, edited and with an introduction by the distinguished Latin American scholar Ilan Stavans and brilliantly translated by an array of well-known poets, also includes some poems previously unavailable in English. <i>I Explain a Few Things </i>distills the poet's brilliance to its most essential and illuminates Neruda's commitment to using the pen as a calibrator for his age.</p></p><p><p><b>Pablo Neruda </b>(1904&#x2013;73) was awarded the Nobel Prize in 1971. His books include <i>Residence on Earth</i>, <i>Canto General</i>, <i>Extravagaria</i>, and <i>Isla Negra</i>. <b>Ilan Stavans</b> is Lewis-Sebring Professor in Latin American and Latino Culture at Amherst College.</p>Perhaps the most popular modern poet in the world, the Chilean-born Neruda (1904&#x2013;1973) won the Nobel Prize for an enormous body of verse that includes introspective lyrics of love and lust; sinuously enthusiastic elemental odes to artichokes, watermelon, salt, Walt Whitman and the human eye; declamations in favor of the labor movement, the Communist Party and the working people of any nation; and involuted late poems of self-doubt. Perhaps no serious writer of verse since Whitman has combined so much scholarly attention with so much enthusiasm in a broad international public: unlike some Latin American peers to whom he paid homage, Neruda even at his most ambitious remained clear in his passions. Memoirist, critic and translator Stavans has culled this useful portable volume, with its facing-page English and Spanish from his far larger (1,040 pages) <i>Poetry of Pablo Neruda</i> (2003), while adding a few translations not included there: translators include Robert Bly, W.S. Merwin and Stavans himself. A particular attraction is Scottish poet Alastair Reid's version of Autumn Testament, Neruda's mid-career retrospect: I've been a great flowing river, the poet asserts, with hard ringing stones, with clear night-noises,/ with dark day-songs. <i>(Oct.)</i> <br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

Even senior managers who have excelled in the workplace for decades confess to concern when plunged into strange, new territory, entering unknown situations, dealing with strangers about whom they know nothing other than their brief bios and some second-hand opinions.<br><br>The purpose of a book like this on human interactions and behavior is to give you information that can become a useful set of tools to help make life at work easier and more successful.<br><br>Everyone who goes to work wants to feel at ease (or "socially comfortable") in his or her surroundings. An executive known as someone at ease is a person who makes others around him comfortable too.<br><br>No one wants to be conspicuous by acting unsophisticated or unknowing. A person at ease walks with grace through the workplace. He thinks about other people, and that unconsciously takes his mind off himself and gives him poise. The fact that others get along well with him is not defined by his designer-made clothes or car of the moment. Rather, it's defined by something as simple as using three common phrases that are automatic, instinctive parts of his everyday vocabulary: "Please," "I'm sorry," and "Thank you." It's that simple. He doesn't have to own Cartier <i>panth�re</i> cufflinks, know how to gossip in a foreign language, or choose the perfect wine every time in a restaurant.<br><br>A cold,</i> ill-at-ease <i>person would say to an employee, "Sorry, but you're going to have to stay tonight until you've analyzed this report and made the required number of copies. We need it for tomorrow's seven o'clock meeting." An</i> at-ease <i>executive would say, "Jim, I hate to have to ask you to stay late to finish the report and the copies tonight, but you're the only one who knows how to make sense out of this. We'll make it up to you for messing up your evening, I promise."</i><br><br>BEING AT EASE ANYWHERE IN THE BUSINESS WORLD<br><br>There is no rest when you are helping to manage a business. You have an excess of responsibility. You must motivate and guide people; watch over their safety, benefits, and health; realize profits; keep morale high; and avoid any criticism of the firm for exploitation of its employees or racism, sexism, or discrimination.<br><br>Luckily, a good manager usually has a good mindset, a positive attitude that is inherent in his actions toward the company, its employees, and the common goals they all share. This attitude is natural and automatic. A good manager does not have to force himself to summon up superhuman strength or a feeling of compassion, or dose of courage, to handle the inevitable people problems that arise in day-to-day work situations. He handles them quickly, fairly, and with insight and understanding.<br><br>A good manager is constantly concerned about the morale of the people on his watch. His employees, in turn, care about his morale, too, and enjoy doing a good job for him. That's teamwork!<br><br>Here are some of the components of an executive's behavior that make others want to be on his team:<br><br>Knowing When to Say "Please"<br><br>Whether you're asking the waitress at the diner to bring you another cup of breakfast coffee or asking your secretary to go to the copy machine, "please" should come forth without self-prompting or even consciously thinking about it. Hollywood, unfortunately, has set a bad example: Network TV shows feature sitcom stars yelling orders to people in their offices as well as waiters or shopkeepers. (There's never a "please" at the beginning or end.) You should view with dismay America's favorite child TV stars ordering around their teachers and parents in their shows each week. These kids would last about four days on a job in the business world.<br><br>Fortunately, the real world bears little resemblance to the screen world, because no matter how bad the manners around us seem to be, most children come to learn that when they grow up, their jobs will depend on how well they behave, not how much they can get away with.<br><br><i>How Many Times a Day Should One Say "Please?"</i><br><br>If you are in the business world, it's impossible to count the number of times. When you make even the slightest request of someone, you should begin or end it with "please." For every favor you ask, "please" should be the entrance or exit word.<br><br>To your spouse: <i>"Please</i> help me entertain the boss at Sunday lunch. I need your help."<br><br>To the taxi driver: "Take me to La Guardia Airport, <i>please."</i><br><br>To the hotel cashier: <i>"Please</i> give me my bill for room 803."<br><br>To your secretary: <i>"Please</i> fax this to John Garrett, with a copy also to Joan Scribner in New Orleans."<br><br>To the waiter: "I'd like to see the wine list, <i>please."</i><br><br>To the CEO: <i>"Please</i> note his criticism of our strategy plan in the second paragraph. It's pretty strong."<br><br>Knowing How to Apologize<br><br><i>(See also</i> "Letter of Apology," Chapter 7)<br><br>The short phrase "I'm sorry" means so much to the person to whom it is addressed, even when you have to push yourself to utter it. Whatever your motivation, when an apology is called for, make it! For example:<br><br>* If you misdial someone on the phone, say "I'm terribly sorry, wrong number," rather than just slam down the receiver in the other person's ear.<br><br>* If you do something really hurtful, such as forgetting an appointment:<br><br>* Telephone your sincere apology.<br><br>* Follow it up with a personal note of apology.<br><br>* Send flowers or a gift of some kind, such as fruit, wine, or candy, to reinforce your apology.<br><br>* If a stranger does something nice, like picking up something you just dropped on the street but didn't notice, tell him with a warm smile of appreciation that he has really "made your day."<br><br>* If you arrive late at a meeting, apologize to the chairman or the host and to the others you have kept waiting.<br><br>* When you give someone in your office too much work to do on an emergency basis, use all three of these phrases:<br><br>"Please do it."<br><br>"I'm sorry to have to ask you to do this."<br><br>"Thank you very much for doing it."<br><br>* If you do something like bump a person as you move rapidly through a hallway, react quickly with a sincere "I'm really sorry. I certainly didn't mean to do that." (Your words will diffuse the hostility your act may have engendered.)<br><br>* If you cause damage to a colleague's possession, apologize profusely, then offer to have it fixed or replaced. For example, when you're a guest in a co-worker's, client's, or your boss's home:<br><br>* If you stain your host's good tablecloth at dinner, arrange to take it to the best dry cleaner available.<br><br>* If you spill something on his pale-colored carpet, arrange to have it professionally cleaned.<br><br>* If you break something, arrange to have it repaired at the best repair shop in town.<br><br>No matter what damage you do in someone else's home or office, always do the best you can to make amends -- and write a good letter of apology.<br><br>Knowing How to Say "Thank You"<br><br><i>(See also</i> "Informal Business Letters" and "Letters of Acknowledgment and Thanks," Chapter 7)<br><br>We should thank people a lot more than we do -- automatically -- but if we think about what we are thanking them for, we'll be more sincere. Some examples of the kinds of situations in our everyday lives where a little expression of gratitude can be very effective:<br><br>* When someone goes back to your office to get your glasses for a meeting<br><br>* When someone from the mailroom brings you the mail<br><br>* When a gas station attendant finishes filling your tank with gas<br><br>* When someone opens a door for you or holds the elevator door for you<br><br>* When someone serves you in any capacity, whether it's your secretary who brings papers to your desk or the person in the employee cafeteria who hands a plate of food across the counter<br><br>* When anyone gives you a gift of any kind<br><br>* When someone does a favor for you<br><br>* When someone praises you<br><br><i>Ways in Which to Say "Thank You" for Substantive Favors or Gifts</i><br><br>* <i>Spoken.</i> Convenient if you happen to run into the person. Careless and not very effective.<br><br>* <i>Telephone.</i> Effective, but only if done within twenty-four hours; if the call is made after that, it seems like an afterthought, not a sincere gesture.<br><br>* <i>Written.</i> The most effective, because it's on the record and can be shown around and reread.<br><br>Compliments -- The Best Way to Accept and Give Them<br><br><i>(See also</i> "Acknowledging a Compliment," Chapter 7)<br><br>Nothing is more affirmative than a compliment. Naturally, that compliment should not be exaggerated, snide, or phony, because then it turns into a negative gesture.<br><br>Say it from the heart.<br><br><i>A Smart Manager Compliments The Staff</i><br><br>Employees may feel they're doing a good job, but they don't know it until they hear it. Praise your staff when they do good work -- when they get things done on time, when they make an extra effort, when they deserve special recognition. Sure, you may see to it that they get a raise the next pay period, but say it with words, not just a personnel action for increased compensation. People need encouragement as they progress in their job. Of course, you should correct any errors or laxities in their work, but how about telling them what a good job they've done on this and that?<br><br><i>Complimenting Your Peers</i><br><br>Many of our parents brought us up according to the rule, "If you can't say anything nice about someone, just don't open your mouth." Not bad advice.<br><br>There's always something you can find to compliment about anyone. It may be the color of a fellow executive's tie, or the print of a woman executive's scarf; it might be an employee's new haircut or snappy looking briefcase; it could be the good looks of his children, as seen in the snapshot on his desk; or the amazing progress an executive in the international division has made with her weekend Japanese lessons. Open your eyes; you'll see it. Then it's up to you to comment on it. It makes people feel good; it lifts their spirits.<br><br>The people with whom you spend all day -- your co-workers -- deserve your praise and cheering up. You have no idea how much influence you can have when you make your peers happy in their jobs. It's another example of an individual' s power for good.<br><br><i>Compliments Are to Be Accepted, Not Rejected</i><br><br>Nothing can take the wind out of a person's sails faster than to have one's compliment rejected. If someone says to you, "I think the proposal you presented this morning was first-rate," the last thing he wants to hear you say is, "I thought I did a lousy job of presenting it. I left out half the strong points." The fact that <i>you personally</i> felt you did not do a good job does not matter. <i>Take the compliment in the spirit in which it was given.</i><br><br>If people compliment you on your appearance, don't correct them and point out all the negatives. For example, if someone says, "You look particularly bright and chipper this morning," don't make a retort, "I feel terrible, my eyes are all puffy from allergies, and I think I look awful."<br><br>What is the right way to accept a compliment? <i>"Thank you.</i> That's really nice of you!"<br><br>When a manager walks with ease through a business day, he makes everyone around him feel more at ease in turn. When he sets an example of excellence, courtesy, and caring, others rise to meet his standards. This is true leadership, out of which teamwork develops.<br><br>If You're a Mean Person, Eventually You'll Get Caught Being Mean<br><br>It's amazing how often a person is caught in his private life, away from the office, when he thinks he's free to act as he darn well pleases. A prime example of this is the young, freshly recuited manager, top of his class at Harvard Business School, who was observed one Saturday (by the wife of the CEO of his new corporation) in the supermarket's overcrowded parking lot. The manager did not see her, however. He had recently been to his boss's home for a lunch where he had impressed everyone with his graceful manners and charm.<br><br>The young business school graduate, driving a fancy sports car and bursting with impatience, looked around the congested parking lot and quickly solved his parking problem by pulling into a spot clearly marked for the handicapped, next to the front door of the store, and shutting out a driver who really <i>was</i> handicapped. By the time the CEO heard the report of this incident from his furious wife, who had spent fifteen minutes trying to find a nonhandicapped parking space, he decided to fire the young newcomer while it was still legally possible. At work that week, the boss told him he had been seen by his wife pulling a fast one after lunch on Saturday. "True meanness just isn't part of our corporate culture," he explained. "You won't go very far in this company, so you'd be better off working elsewhere."<br><br>The story has a happy ending, fortunately. The fired manager found another job and proceeded to work hard on weekends and at nighttime donating his services to the local hospital. At the end of a year he was given an award as the outstanding volunteer in the suburban community, which his old boss read about in the newspaper. He got his old job back.<br><br>When You're the New Kid on the Block<br><br>When you join a company, either in your first executive position or as a transfer from another company, you might as well accept the fact that you will be an object of curiosity and probably of some suspicion as well. You might also be a hate object for someone who thought he was going to obtain the position you have been retained to fill.<br><br>Remember, time is the great healer and dealer. It doesn't matter how cool the atmosphere may be when you arrive in your job. What matters is that you take your time to establish good personal relations and proceed slowly and carefully -- the opposite of a shotgun approach. Here are some tips on how to handle yourself:<br><br>* <i>Listen and learn, rather than do all the talking.</i> Don't think you have to justify yourself to everyone. Spend your energies observing and asking smart questions rather than trying to let everyone know how much you know and how important you are.<br><br>* <i>Be equally nice to everyone.</i> The messenger may someday turn out to be your best friend in court. The receptionist may one day be able to give you the most important information of your life. The junior executive in the office next to yours whom you don't think is very important may one day be your boss.<br><br>* <i>Don't make snap judgments</i> about who's important, who's going to be your friend. You may change your mind about most of the people in the office, so it's smart not to form an opinion of anyone until you know them well and have seen them interact. Don't listen to negative stories about who's out to get whom, who's about to get fired, who's cheating. Resolve to keep an open mind and to make your own judgments later -- much later.<br><br>* <i>Ask your peers to lunch, one by one</i> (one a week, for example). Get to know them on an easy, informal basis. It will be money well invested. Assume an "I honestly need your help to learn how this company works" attitude. If you make your peers understand that you need their assistance, that you know less than they do but need to know more in order to become a good <i>team member,</i> you will find they will help you. They won't mind your asking for information. What does <i>not</i> work is arrogance; what <i>does</i> work is m...</p><h2>The Mis-Education of the Negro</h2><p>Originally released in 1933, <i>The Mis-Education of the Negro</i> continues to resonate today, raising questions that readers are still trying to answer. The impact of slavery on the Black psyche is explored and questions are raised about our education system, such as what and who African Americans are educated for, the difference between education and training, and which of these African Americans are receiving. Woodson provides solutions to these challenges, but these require more study, discipline, and an Afrocentric worldview. This new edition contains a biographical profile of the author, a new introduction, and study questions.<br></p><p>This edition of Carter G. Woodson&#39;s classic, &#34;The Mis-Education of the Negro,&#34; is newly and professionally laid out (as opposed to a facsimile edition).<b>Carter G.

When her Aunt Jean dies suddenly, Suzanne and her mother investigate what at first looks like an accident, but quickly proves to be murder.

So even though all the other villagers of St. Hampton Heath are swooning over the newly returned seventh Earl of Hawkesbury, she is not impressed. If a man won't take his responsibilities seriously and help those who are supposed to be able to depend on him, he deserves no respect from her. In Lavinia's pretty, gray eyes, Nicholas Stamford is just as arrogant and reckless as his brother--who stole the most important person in Livvie's world.<br><br>Nicholas is weighed down by his own guilt and responsibility, by the pain his careless brother caused, and by the legacy of war he's just left. This quick visit home to St. Hampton Heath will be just long enough to ease a small part of that burden. Asking him to bother with the lives of the villagers when there's already a bailiff on the job is simply too much to expect.<br><br>That is, until the hoydenish, intelligent, and very opinionated Miss Ellison challenges him to see past his pain and pride. With her angelic voice in his head, he may even be beginning to care. But his isn't the only heart that needs to change.<br><br>These two lonely hearts may each have something the other needs. But with society's opposition, ancestral obligations, and a shocking family secret, there may be too many obstacles in their way.<br><br><b>Fans of Georgette Heyer, Lori Wick, and Julie Klassen will enjoy the spirited exchanges between the bluestocking minister's daughter and the bruised war hero as they move past pride and presumption to a humbled appreciation of God's grace and the true strength of love.</b></p><p>I hope you enjoy reading 'The Elusive Miss Ellison' - she was certainly a lot of fun to write about! I love reading about feisty heroines as much as the next redhead :) but sometimes too much 'feist' can come across as just rude. Miss Ellison has some sass, but a warm heart, and when she meets her match in Lord Hawkesbury, she begins to learn a few home truths. I try to create characters that face some of the same challenges and problems as we all do at times: issues with families, loneliness, financial constraints, society's expectations. It's my hope that people can identify with, and appreciate the journey these characters go on, from presumption to understanding, from pride to humility, and be inspired with hope, as these characters transform into people we want to be. People who forgive, who extend grace to the unlovely, who care more about other people than they do about their appearance. People who bring kindness into the world.&nbsp; Miss Ellison has been close to my heart for years - I hope she'll grow close to yours, too. And don't forget to look out for her cousin's story, 'The Captivating Lady Charlotte', releasing mid-2017!<i>Pride, prejudice and forgiveness...</i><br> Hampton Hall's new owner has the villagers of St. Hampton Heath all aflutter--all except Lavinia Ellison. The reverend's daughter cares for those who are poor and sick, and the seventh Earl of Hawkesbury definitely does <i>not&nbsp;</i>meet that criteria. His refusal to take his responsibilities seriously, or even darken the door of the church, leave her convinced he is as arrogant and reckless as his brother--his brother who stole the most important person in Lavinia's world.<br><br>Nicholas Stamford is shadowed by guilt: his own, his brother's, the legacy of war. A perfunctory visit to this dreary part of Gloucestershire wasn't supposed to engage his heart, or his mind. Challenged by Miss Ellison's fascinating blend of Bluestocking opinions, hoydenish behavior, and angelic voice, he finds the impossible becoming possible--he begins to care. But Lavinia's aloof manner, society's opposition and his ancestral obligations prove most frustrating, until scandal forces them to get along.&nbsp; <br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>Can Lavinia and Nicholas look beyond painful pasts and present prejudice to see their future? And what will happen when Lavinia learns a family secret that alters everything she's ever known?</p><h2>Visions and Appearances of Jesus</h2><p>Can you imagine how extraordinary and transcendent it would be to have Jesus appear before you? For the people discussed in this book, that is just what happened. This book surveys these awe-inspiring accounts over the centuries and down to the present time.<p>No serious doubt seems to exist that visions of Jesus have occurred and might continue today. Even those who are skeptical about the reality of religious experiences seem to agree that such visions have occurred, although they tend to dismiss them as hallucinations. However, enough reports have occurred in the history of the church to make such reports believable.</p><p><i>Visions and Appearances of Jesus</i> examines the remarkable fact that Jesus has seemingly appeared to people in every century. Phillip Wiebe examines this claim, highlighting details of the ''encounter experiences'' of 28 living people, whom he personally interviewed. He presents ongoing experiences as supporting evidence for the biblical claims that Jesus was seen alive after his death, and defends the resurrection as understood by Christian tradition.</p></p><p>No serious doubt seems to exist that visions of Jesus have occurred and might continue today.

This time he caught Alex Driscal in the, parking lot and smashed his head against the sidewalk. Now, Alex may have permanent brain damage'and Cole is in the Biggest trouble of his life.<p>Cole is offered Circle Justice: a system based on Native American traditions that attempts to provide healing for the criminal offender, the victim and the, community. With prison as his only alternative, Cole plays along. He says he wants to repent, but in his heart Cole blames his alcoholic mom his, abusive dad, wimpy Alex -- everyone but himself -- for his situation.</p><p>Cole receives a one-year banishment to a remote Alaskan island. There, he is mauled by Mysterious white bear of Native American legend. Hideously injured, Cole waits for his death His thoughts shift from from Anger to humility. To survive, he must stop blaming others and take responsibility for his life. Rescuers arrive to save Cole's but it is the attack of the Spirit Bear that may save his soul. </p><p>Ben Mikaelsen paints a vivid picture of a juvenile offender, examining the roots without absolving solving him of responsibility for his actions, and questioning a society in which angry people make victims of their peers and communities. Touching Spirit Bear is a poignant testimonial to the power of a pain that can destroy, or lead to healing</p></p><p>Cole Matthews is angry. Angry, defiant, smug--in short, a bully. His anger has taken him too far this time, though. After beating up a ninth-grade classmate to the point of brain damage, Cole is facing a prison sentence. But then a Tlingit Indian parole officer named Garvey enters his life, offering an alternative called Circle Justice, based on Native American traditions, in which victim, offender, and community all work together to find a healing solution. Privately, Cole sneers at the concept, but he's no fool--if it gets him out of prison, he'll do anything. Ultimately, Cole ends up banished for one year to a remote Alaskan island, where his arrogance sets him directly in the path of a mysterious, legendary white bear. Mauled almost to death, Cole awaits his fate and begins the transition from anger to humility. <p> Ben Mikaelsen's depiction of a juvenile delinquent's metamorphosis into a caring, thinking individual is exciting and fascinating, if at times heavy-handed. Cole's nastiness and the vivid depictions of the lengths he must go to survive after the (equally vivid) attack by the bear are excruciating at times, but the concept of finding a way to heal a whole community when one individual wrongs another is compelling. The jacket cover photo of the author in a bear hug with the 700-pound black bear that he and his wife adopted and raised is definitely worth seeing!

Banished to a remote Alaskan island, Cole's rage and isolation lead him to another brazen attack. This time, his intended victim is the Spirit Bear of Native American legend?and the clumsy assault ends with Cole mauled nearly to death. Rescuers arrive to save Cole's life, but it is the attack of the Spirit Bear that is the start of Cole's long journey to accepting responsibility for his life and saving his soul.<br></p><h2>Inerrancy and Worldview</h2><p><p>Though the Bible presents a personal and relational God, popular modern worldviews portray an impersonal divine force in a purely material world. Readers influenced by this competing worldview hold assumptions about fundamental issues&#x2015;like the nature of humanity, evil, and the purpose of life&#x2015;that present profound obstacles to understanding the Bible.</p><p>In <em>Inerrancy and Worldview</em>, Dr. Vern Poythress offers the first worldview-based defense of scriptural inerrancy, showing how worldview differences create or aggravate most perceived difficulties with the Bible. His positive case for biblical inerrancy implicitly critiques the worldview of theologians like Enns, Sparks, Allert, and McGowan. Poythress, who has researched and published in a variety of fields&#x2015; including science, linguistics, and sociology&#x2015;deals skillfully with the challenges presented in each of these disciplines. By directly addressing key examples in each field, Poythress shows that many difficulties can be resolved simply by exposing the influence of modern materialism.</p><p><em>Inerrancy and Worldview&#x2019;s</em> positive response to current attempts to abandon or redefine inerrancy will enable Christians to respond well to modern challenges by employing a worldview that allows the Bible to speak on its own terms.</p></p><p><p><strong>Vern S. Poythress</strong> (PhD, Harvard University; ThD, University of Stellenbosch) is professor of New Testament interpretation at Westminster Theological Seminary in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he has taught for nearly four decades. In addition to earning six academic degrees, he is the author of numerous books and articles on biblical interpretation, language, and science.</p><p>,&nbsp;Professor of New Testament Interpretation, Westminster Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;I can think of no one in the world better qualified to write a defense of biblical inerrancy than my lifelong friend Vern Poythress. This book is no ordinary defense of inerrancy that merely focuses on proposed solutions to several difficult verses (though it does examine some of them). Rather, it is a wide-ranging analysis that exposes the faulty intellectual assumptions that underlie challenges to the Bible from every major academic discipline in the modern university world. I think every Christian student at every secular university should read and absorb the arguments in this book. It is profoundly wise, insightful, and clearly written, and it will surely strengthen every reader&#x2019;s confidence in the trustworthiness of the Bible as the very words of God.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Wayne Grudem,</strong>&nbsp;Distinguished Research Professor of Theology and Biblical Studies, Phoenix Seminary; author,&nbsp;<em>Christian Ethics</em></p><p>&#x201c;Vern Poythress has written what I consider to be definitive books on many subjects, including biblical interpretation, language, science, and sociology. In <em>Inerrancy and Worldview</em>, he brings his insights from these disciplines and more together to address the relation of biblical inerrancy to worldview. He shows quite convincingly that the issue of inerrancy is not just a matter of asking whether this or that biblical passage is factual. Rather, our attitude toward the claim of biblical inerrancy depends on our general view of how God is related to the cosmos and to us as individuals and societies. And that general view, in turn, depends on our relationship to Jesus Christ. The book gets deeper into the question of inerrancy than any other book I know.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>John M. Frame,</strong>&nbsp;Professor of Systematic Theology and Philosophy Emeritus, Reformed Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;Every new item that Vern Poythress writes is thoughtful, creative, and worth reading. This book is no exception. Among the many things I like about it is his emphasis on the personalist worldview of the Bible, as over against the impersonalism that dominates modern Western culture. Besides its crucial contribution to his own subject in clarifying how it is that God communicates to us through the Bible, I think this basic idea will be fruitful for a good number of other topics as well. Thanks, Dr. Poythress, and thanks, God, for giving him to the Church.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>C. John Collins,</strong> Professor of Old Testament, Covenant Theological Seminary</p><p>&#x201c;Vern Poythress has provided both the church and the academy a remarkable service with <em>Inerrancy and Worldview</em>. Recognizing that the modern objection to Scripture is neither univocal nor objective, but rather varied and religious, he helpfully reframes the discussion in terms of competing worldviews. By surveying the various options for the allegiance of the modern mind, Poythress shows that not only is an inerrant Bible a reasonable expectation of a personal God, but our rejection of it is rooted not in evidence, but in our sinful rebellion against that God. With clear logic and pastoral care, Poythress leads us through an amazing tour of both the &#x2018;wisdom of our age&#x2019; and the follies of our hearts, bringing us at last to the God who speaks&#x2015;humbling our pride and setting our hearts free.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Michael Lawrence,</strong>&nbsp;Senior Pastor, Hinson Baptist Church, Portland, Oregon; author, <em>Biblical Theology in the Life of the Church</em></p><p>&#x201c;To our shame, the response of Christians to challenges to our faith can often be dismissive, shallow, defensive, or disrespectful. On the other hand, we can err too much on the side of tolerance for error when truth is under siege. In <em>Inerrancy and Worldview</em>, Vern Poythress shows us how to be neither fools nor cowards. Through intelligent, informed, insightful, and respectful engagement, key foundational faith defeaters taught in many disciplines at every secular university are explained and critiqued from a biblical perspective. Poythress challenges the challenges to biblical belief at the root of their assumptions. We are left with a solid basis and defense of the Christian way of thinking. <em>Inerrancy and Worldview</em> should be required reading for all who want to think more deeply about their faith and defend it within a skeptical culture.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>K.

Expelled from Oxford for indecent behaviour, Paul Pennyfeather is oddly unsurprised to find himself qualifying for the position of schoolmaster at Llanabba Castle. Hi colleagues are an assortment of misfits, including Prendy (plagued by doubts) and captain Grimes, who is always in the soup (or just plain drunk). Then Sports Day arrives, and with it the delectable Margot Beste-Chetwynde, floating on a scented breeze. As the farce unfolds and the young run riot, no one is safe, least of all Paul. Taking its title from Edward Gibbon&#39;s Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire, Evelyn Waugh&#39;s first, funniest novel immediately caught the ear of the public with his account of an ing�nu abroad in the decadent confusion of 1920s high society. &#39;The funniest book I have ever read&#39; Julian Symons, The Times &#39;His first, most perfect novel ... a ruthlessly comic plot&#39; John Mortimer, Guardian &#39;Concocted of cruelty, bigotry, pederasty, white slavery, violence, madness and murder, Decline and Fall is fundamentally playful and side-splittingly funny&#39; David Bradshaw</p><p>7 1-hour cassettesDecline and Fall (1928) was Evelyn Waugh's immensely successful first novel, and it displays not only all of its author's customary satiric genius and flair for unearthing the ridiculous in human nature, but also a youthful willingness to train those weapons on any and every thing in his path.

The underlying causes go back to business left unfinished by both the Second and First World Wars. In this acclaimed book, now revised and updated with a new chapter on the Dayton Accords and the subsequent U.S. involvement, Misha Glenny offers a sobering eyewitness chronicle of the events that rekindled the violent conflict, a lucid and impartial analysis of the politics behind them, and incisive portraits of the main personalities involved.

Reflecting on the mysteries of Creation, the Holy Trinity, the Incarnation, and the Eucharist, he examines in his distinctive lucid style the ways in which Christian faith contributes to the understanding of the human person.</p><p>The book is divided into four sections. The first directly addresses the relation between faith and understanding, showing how philosophy has an autonomy within Christian theology even as it acknowledges that revelation makes known truths that could not have been reached by reason alone. It also explains how central the doctrine of Creation is to the relation between faith and reason. The rest of the book illustrates particular ways in which reason and faith interact in Christianity.</p><p>The second section deals with the mysteries of the Holy Trinity, the Church, and the Eucharist. It shows that Christ is the primary minister of the Eucharist because his words are quoted in its celebration, and it offers a contemporary interpretation of the meaning of transubstantiation. This section also discusses the episcopal teaching office in the Church, and it shows how Christ's words in the gospels, his use of the first-person pronoun, serve to manifest the Holy Trinity.</p> <br><p></p><br><p>The third section discusses the human person in the light of Christian faith, exploring what is meant by the human soul, natural law, and personal relationships, as well as the place of political philosophy within revelation. The fourth and final section turns to the relationship between faith and practical reasoning. It discusses Christian aspects in the art and science of medicine, psychoanalysis, and the professions, as well as issues in Catholic higher education, including the place of philosophy in seminary formation. </p><p>Robert Sokolowski is Elizabeth Breckenridge Caldwell Professor of Philosophy at The Catholic University of America.

Elvis spent years navigating the wild world of radio as a DJ for hire, working (and partying) in markets around the country before taking over the morning shift at the legendary Z100 in 1996. Over the last twenty years, he has become one of New York City&#x2019;s signature voices (<i>Variety </i>calls him &#x201c;a permanent fixture of the area&#x2019;s daily commutes&#x201d;) thanks to his show&#x2019;s exciting mix of music, new artist discovery<i>, </i>interviews, gossip, and live listener interaction.<br> <br> Along the way, Elvis has become known not just for his incisive interviews (and occasional feuds) with pop music&#x2019;s biggest stars, but for the show&#x2019;s commitment to kindness and positivity and Elvis&#x2019;s own candor and openness with his audience.<br> <br> Bold, funny, and totally candid, <i>Where Do I Begin? </i>is sure to be loved by anyone who listens to Elvis live every morning&#x2014;or anyone who wants to know what really goes on behind the scenes of the pop music machine. It reads like an old friend telling a new story you&#x2019;ve been dying to hear.</p><p>Elvis Duran&nbsp;is one of America&#x2019;s most well-known and widely admired media personalities. His nationally syndicated radio program, <i>Elvis Duran and the Morning Show</i>, is America&#x2019;s most-listened-to Top 40 morning show and one of the 10 most-listened-to programs in all of radio, heard live by nearly 10 million people in more than 80 markets across the country. Meanwhile, Elvis&#x2019;s regular appearances on NBC&#x2019;s <i>Today</i>, <i>Late Night with Jimmy Fallon</i>, <i>Entertainment Tonight</i>, and other television shows have made him not just a beloved voice, but a familiar face for fans of pop culture.Prologue: This Is a Nightmare PROLOGUE This Is a Nightmare <br>My pulse is pounding. My hands are sweaty. I think I just crapped my pants.<br> <br>Look. I don&#x2019;t get nervous. Not even when I&#x2019;m about to go live to ten million people as the host of a national radio show with my name on it.<br> <br>That stuff&#x2019;s easy. But this? Writing a <i>book</i>? A book about <i>me</i>?<br> <br>This is <i>agonizing.</i><br> <br>You wouldn&#x2019;t think it would be so hard to talk about myself. I do it every day on the radio. And it&#x2019;s not as if I&#x2019;m afraid to tell you embarrassing stories about myself. I mean, this whole <i>book</i> is full of stories about getting drunk and getting high, getting fired and getting dumped, getting fat and getting thin. Want to hear about the time I pissed the bed on a romantic vacation? No problem.<br> <br>One time, the guy I was dating took me to Hawaii. I&#x2019;d been going nuts with work, and I was stressed out and exhausted, so he swept me away to this gorgeous house we&#x2019;d rented on a hillside overlooking the ocean. Hot, right?<br> <br>So, we get to this peaceful oasis, have a pi�a colada or two, and then within about five seconds of putting my head on the pillow, I&#x2019;m out cold. After months of pent-up exhaustion, I&#x2019;m taking the greatest nap of all time.<br> <br>And then, well, you know how sometimes you have a dream where you really have to go, and you make your way to the dream bathroom, and you&#x2019;re dream-peeing, except then you wake up in a puddle of hot pee?<br> <br>And you know something? I didn&#x2019;t try to hide it from my guy. And I have no problem telling you about it, either (after all, it&#x2019;s not like I peed in <i>your</i> bed). My point: Most people would never admit they peed the bed. Me? I talk about it in a book. Not gonna hold back from ya, okay? In fact, that&#x2019;s not even the only story about inappropriate urination in this book. I should have called it <i>All the Places I Shouldn&#x2019;t Have Peed</i>.<br> <br>I have no shame, and no filter, when it comes to talking to you about wetting the bed. What bothers me is having to dig deeper.<br> <br>I know how to ask the kind of questions that get to the heart of who a person really is and how they got that way&#x2014;I do it every day on the radio. But having to <i>answer</i> them is terrifying. Jimmy Fallon recently invited me to be a guest on <i>The Tonight Show</i>. Where HE&#x2019;S the interviewer. But it didn&#x2019;t take long before I found myself flipping the script and starting to ask HIM questions. I&#x2019;m just more comfortable on that side of the conversation.<br> <br>But as much as I&#x2019;d rather talk about you, this is a book about me. And if Elvis Duran were a guest on my show, I wouldn&#x2019;t let him get away with just telling some funny stories. I&#x2019;d want to know exactly how a kid from a small town in Texas made his way to New York City&#x2014;how a shy, quiet loner wound up on top in a business where all you do is talk to people. And if he said, &#x201c;Oh, well, just lucky, I suppose,&#x201d; and then tried to change the subject, I&#x2019;d say, &#x201c;Bullshit.&#x201d;<br> <br>The truth is, I <i>have</i> been lucky. <i>Unbelievably</i> lucky. But I&#x2019;ve also had setbacks. I&#x2019;ve made mistakes&#x2014;not just the lose-your-hotel-room-deposit kind, but the people-get-hurt kind. And I&#x2019;ve learned some tough lessons the hard way&#x2014;not just about the radio business, but about myself.<br> <br>Which brings me back to this book&#x2014;or, rather, the blank page I&#x2019;m staring at that has to turn <i>into</i> a book or else the ghosts of Simon and Schuster themselves are going to come downtown to my apartment in Tribeca and burn out my eyeballs with their cigarettes.<br> <br>Turning the microphone on myself like this is a total nightmare. But I&#x2019;m going to do it anyway. And here&#x2019;s why.<br> <br>My favorite thing about what I do for a living is that, even though we play music and talk about Hollywood gossip, our show is about <i>real people</i>. Even someone like Katy Perry&#x2014;someone who&#x2019;s way more famous than you or I will ever be and talented in ways we can only dream about&#x2014;she&#x2019;s a real person, just like anyone else.<br> <br>The thing about real people is, we all go through moments of doubt. We all have pet peeves and secret fears and aspirations we&#x2019;re too embarrassed to admit out loud. We all screw up. We all have dreams that haven&#x2019;t come true&#x2014;yet. And whether I&#x2019;m talking to a Grammy-winning pop star or a caller on her way to drop her kids off at school, that&#x2019;s the stuff I think is fascinating. The real stuff.<br> <br>And I&#x2019;m a real person, too. My life is fast and fun and occasionally fabulous, but the stories that have shaped it&#x2014;the moments that made me who I am&#x2014;could have happened to anyone. And if I tell you those stories in these pages, maybe you&#x2019;ll recognize something from your own life. Maybe you&#x2019;ll realize something new about yourself. Maybe we&#x2019;ll be able to connect on a whole different level. Making those connections is the best part of my job. I think it&#x2019;s the best part of <i>life</i> itself.<br> <br>So, fine. I&#x2019;ll tell you everything. Even the stuff that makes me cry or cringe or want to slam my head on the coffee table.<br> <br><i>Deep breath.</i><br> <br>Here goes.<br></p><h2>Dixie Be Damned: 300 Years of Insurrection in the American South</h2><p><p>In 1891, when coal companies in eastern Tennessee brought in cheap convict labor to take over their jobs, workers responded by storming the stockades, freeing the prisoners, and loading them onto freight trains. Over the next year, tactics escalated to include burning company property and looting company stores. This was one of the largest insurrections in US working-class history. It happened at the same time as the widely publicized northern labor war in Homestead, Pennsylvania. And it was largely ignored, then and now.</p><p><i>Dixie Be Damned</i> engages seven similarly "hidden" insurrectionary episodes in Southern history to demonstrate the region's long arc of revolt. Countering images of the South as pacified and conservative, this adventurous retelling presents history in the rough. Not the image of the South many expect, this is the South of maroon rebellion, wildcat strikes, and Robert F. Williams's book <i>Negroes with Guns</i>, a South where the dispossessed refuse to quietly suffer their fate. This is people's history at its best: slave revolts, multiracial banditry, labor battles, prison uprisings, urban riots, and more.</p><p><b>Neal Shirley</b> grew up in Winston-Salem, North Carolina, and now lives in Durham, NC, where he is involved in several anti-prison initiatives and runs a small publishing project called the North Carolina Piece Corps.</p><p><b>Saralee Stafford</b> was born in the Piedmont of North Carolina.

These discourses were presented in America with a Western audience in mind, and have been specially edited for this volume. The openness, simplicity, and depth of realization in his teachings have brought inspiration to many, and greater understanding of the wisdom Buddhism has to offer. The topics covered range from the most subtle psychology and metaphysics to everyday life and practice. Readers new to Buddhism will find lucid and profound explanations of the fundamental teachings; those already familiar with Buddhism will discover unexpected insights into the heart of the tradition.</p><p><p>Born in Eastern Tibet, Kalu Rinpoche was trained in monasteries and retreat centers. He spent many years of solitary retreat in remote mountains. Thereafter he was summoned back to the monastery to teach and guide practice. A few years before the Chinese occupation of Tibet, he left the country and eventually settled in India. Since then, he has travelled extensively, teaching and establishing centers in Asia, Europe, and North America where his tradition of meditative practice is maintained.</p></p><h2>Deep Ancestry: Inside The Genographic Project</h2><p>Travel backward through time from today's scattered billions to the handful of early humans who lived in Africa 60,000 years ago and are ancestors to us all. <br><br>In <i>Deep Ancestry</i>, scientist and National Geographic explorer Spencer Wells shows how tiny genetic changes add up over time into a fascinating story. Using scores of real-life examples, helpful analogies, and detailed diagrams and illustrations, he explains exactly how each and every individual's DNA contributes another piece to the jigsaw puzzle of human history. The book takes readers inside the Genographic Project&#x2014;the landmark study now assembling the world's largest collection of DNA samples and employing the latest in testing technology and computer analysis to examine hundreds of thousand of genetic profiles from all over the globe&#x2014;and invites us all to take part.</p><p>Spencer Wells is an Explorer-in-Residence at the National Geographic Society and the director of the Genographic Project. After studying under genetic pioneer Luigi Cavalli-Sforza at Stanford University, he began an unusual career that mixes science, writing, and filmmaking. His acclaimed first book, <i>The Journey of Man,</i> combined his own DNA research with the work of archaeologists, paleoanthropologists, paleoclimatologists, and linguists to show how modern humans came to populate the planet.In this concise and well-written work, Wells (The Journey of Man) provides an accessible introduction to genetic anthropology, the study of human history using genetic evidence. Wells is the director of the Genographic Project, which collects DNA samples from a wide array of world populations to better understand human history over the last 200,000 years. Wells does a fantastic job distilling both genetics and genetic anthropology into straightforward topics, presenting sophisticated material accessibly without oversimplification. He gives the reader the basic concepts (Y chromosomes, mtDNA, haplogroups, genetic markers) and then proceeds to step through genographic research from its 19th-century origins to the present day. In so doing, he takes the reader back to the 170,000-year-old female genetic ancestor of every person alive today: the so-called African Eve. It is a remarkable journey that will appeal to readers of all backgrounds interested in exploring the science and research behind human evolution, although those with more experience in the sciences may find some of the material elementary.<br>Copyright � Reed Business Information, a division of Reed Elsevier Inc.

From their diverse fragrances to their nasty deceptions, Russell proves that, where nature is concerned, &#34;wonder is not only our starting point; it can also be our destination.&#34; Throughout this botanical journey, she reveals that the science behind these intelligent plants--how they evolved, how they survive, how they heal--is even more awe-inspiring than their fleeting beauty. Russell helps us imagine what a field of snapdragons looks like to a honeybee; she introduces us to flowers that regulate their own temperature, attract pollinating bats, even smell like a rotting corpse.In this poetic rumination, which combines graceful writing with a scientist&#39;s clarity, Russell brings together the work of botanists around the globe, and illuminates a world at once familiar and exotic.</p><p>The flower, paleontologists tell us, is an ancient innovation in the endless struggle of adaptation and survival; the earliest fossil flowers date to some 120 million years ago, long after the arrival of other forms of plant life (and, for that matter, insects). Their arrival heralded a new way for plants to go forth and multiply that was so successful that countless animal and insect species now depend on flowers for food, and flowering plants have spread across the face of the earth.<p> "We know that flowers are beautiful," writes essayist Sharman Apt Russell in this lyrical exploration of the flowering world. "We forget that they are also essential." In fact, the more we learn about them, the more essential the 250,000 known species of flowering plants appear to be to modern life. Scientists are only now beginning to understand the complex role of flowers in ecosystems, and their studies have turned up surprising discoveries (such as the fact that a single flower can produce more than a hundred chemical compounds, and that plants like the alpine pennycress and sunflower can remove toxic chemicals from earth and water). Russell takes us to laboratories and academic conferences, as well as sun-drenched fields and greenhouses, to relate the science and lore of flowers. She also warns that, with one in three species in the United States alone already at risk, flowers may well prove to be among the first victims of a mounting wave of extinctions.</p><p> Russell's poetic book complements standards such as Donald Culross Peattie's <i>Flowering Earth</i> and Peter Tompkins's <i>Secret Life of Plants</i>. Fans of botany, ecology, and plain good writing will find much of value in its pages. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p><b>Sharman Apt Russell</b> is the author of several books, including <i>Hunger</i> and <i>Songs of the Fluteplayer</i>, which won the Mountains and Plains Booksellers Award.

Within the week, the Spanish Armada had set sail, and its victory changed the course of history. <p>1968: England is still dominated by the Church of Rome. There are no telephones, no television, no nuclear power. AS Catholicism and the Inquisition tighten their grip, rebellion is growing.</p></p><p>An ever-expanding subgenre of science fiction is devoted to "alternate worlds" or "alternate histories": fiction in which a crucial event goes differently than in the world we know, and history is changed. Keith Roberts's <i>Pavane</i> (1968) is set in a backward 20th century molded by the assassination of Queen Elizabeth I and the triumph of a militantly antiscience Catholic Church. This is a classic alternate history, in the same company as such highly regarded novels as L. Sprague De Camp's seminal <i>Lest Darkness Fall</i> (1941), in which a modern man slips back in time and attempts to avert the Dark Ages; Ward Moore's <i>Bring the Jubilee</i> (1953), set after the South wins the U.S. Civil War; and Philip K. Dick's <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> (1962), set after the Germans and Japanese win World War II. <i>Lest Darkness Fall</i> and <i>The Man in the High Castle</i> are justly famous; the other two classics, <i>Bring the Jubilee</i> and <i>Pavane</i>, are less well known, and that is a shame.<p> One reason for <i>Pavane</i>'s relative obscurity among American SF readers might be its British setting and author (the Moore and Dick novels are both set in the U.S., and De Camp, Moore, and Dick were all American). Another reason might be that <i>Pavane</i> is a novel created from interrelated but standalone stories (six "measures," or novelettes, and a coda), and the stories are of varying quality. Most are wise, beautifully written, and intensely visualized, especially the opener, "The Lady Margaret," and the closer, "Corfe Gate"; but "Brother John," the story of the monk-artist who witnesses Inquisition tortures and sparks an anti-Church rebellion, is far less detailed, and sometimes even unclear. Another reason for the novel's obscurity may be that some of the stories/chapters have more of a fantasy feel than is typical of more recent alternate history. Also, the nature of the coda's revelations may put off some readers. Nonetheless, <i>Pavane</i> is an intelligent, powerful, and moving work, deserving of a wide readership. <i>--Cynthia Ward</i></p>1588, Queen Elizabeth of England was assassinated. As a result, when the Spanish Armada attacked, England went down defeated, changing the history of Europe and the New World as we know it.<br><br>Now, in the Twentieth Century, the Church of Rome reigns supreme over a world of pastoral beauty, while technology is held back to the level of the steam locomotive and the primitive radio. Yet science cannot be suppressed forever, and its advocates are becoming more daring as each year passes. A revolution is building&#x2015;one that will rock the foundations of an empire. An acknowledged classic of alternate history fiction, Pavane will continue to inspire writers and readers for generations . . .<br></p><h2>The Shaman and the Medicine Wheel</h2><p>&#34;The more we meditate on the Medicine Wheel and on the Cosmic Wheel above, relating these to the circles, spheres, and mandalas of other traditions, the deeper our realization grows of the oneness of the many paths leading to the Center.&#34; Although Evelyn Eaton walked principally the Native Indian path, this book reflects her belief in the strength and beauty of all religious traditions. This is the personal account of her triumph over cancer through Native American healing rituals.

Besides a young Whitman, the circle included actor Edwin Booth; trailblazing stand-up comic Artemus Ward; psychedelic drug pioneer and author Fitz Hugh Ludlow; and brazen performer Adah Menken, famous for her Naked Lady routine. Central to their times, the artists managed to forge connections with Ralph Waldo Emerson, Mark Twain, and even Abraham Lincoln. This vibrant tale, packed with original research, offers the pleasures of a great group biography like <i>The Banquet Years</i> or <i>The Metaphysical Club</i>. Justin Martin shows how this first bohemian culture-imported from Paris to a dingy Broadway saloon-seeded and nurtured an American tradition of rebel art that thrives to this day.<br><br></p><p>Justin Martin is the author of three highly praised previous biographies: <i>Greenspan: the Man behind Money, Nader: Crusader, Spoiler, Icon</i>, and <i>Genius of Place: The Life of Frederick Law Olmsted</i>. As one of the few journalists to gain access to Greenspan, Martin produced a best-selling biography of the secretive Fed chairman, selected as a notable book by the <i>New York Times Book Review</i>. Martin's Nader biography served as a primary source for <i> An Unreasonable Man </i>, an Academy Award&#x2013;nominated documentary. <i>Genius of Place</i>, the first full scale biography of Olmsted received glowing reviews nationally. Martin's articles have appeared in a variety of publications, including <i>Fortune, Newsweek</i>, and the <i>San Francisco Chronicle </i>."Whitman now is a central figure in the American canon, but his Pfaff's pals are all but forgotten. In Rebel Souls, biographer Justin Martin brings them wonderfully to life in his enjoyable romp through the milieu. Whitman is the emotional core of the book - Martin's passages on Whitman's romantic travails and his experiences tending to wounded soldiers during the Civil War are unforgettably moving. But the other members of the Pfaff's coterie almost steal the show."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Boston Globe</i></b></i></b><br><br>"The book is a veritable who's who of the 19th-century's movers and shakers."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Cape Cod Times</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Martin's historical scope and elegiac prose, laced through with parlance of the period, is not only grandly entertaining to read, it rescues this bit of cultural history and gives Whitman a more human dimension past the iconic image."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>New York Journal of Books</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Anyone who loves history, and particularly literary history, will want to read this book."<br> &#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Hudson Valley News</i></b></i></b><br><br>"Fascinating and eye-opening."&#x2015;<b><i><b><i>Waterbury Republican-American</i></b></i></b><br><br>"In this captivating study, Martin transports the reader to the 1850s inside smoky Pfaff's saloon-the meeting place of the US's first Bohemians...Thanks to meticulous research, Martin was able to re-create the Bohemian scene, and Whitman's place in it, in vivid detail.

After decorating the walls with art by Picasso and other avant-garde artists, they embarked on a series of extravagant performances. Three readers simultaneously recited a poem in three languages; a monocle-wearing teenager performed a spell from New Zealand; another young man sneered at the audience, snapping a whip as he intoned his Fantastic Prayers.&#x201d; One of the artists called these sessions both buffoonery and a requiem mass.&#x201d; Soon they would have a more evocative name: Dada.<br><br>In <i>Destruction Was My Beatrice</i>, modernist scholar Jed Rasula presents the first narrative history of Dada, showing how this little-understood artistic phenomenon laid the foundation for culture as we know it today. Although the venue where Dada was born closed after only four months and its acolytes scattered, the idea of Dada quickly spread to New York, where it influenced artists like Marcel Duchamp and Man Ray; to Berlin, where it inspired painters George Grosz and Hannah H�ch; and to Paris, where it dethroned previous avant-garde movements like Fauvism and Cubism while inspiring early Surrealists like Andr� Breton, Louis Aragon, and Paul �luard. The long tail of Dadaism, Rasula shows, can be traced even further, to artists as diverse as William S. Burroughs, Robert Rauschenberg, Marshall McLuhan, the Beatles, Monty Python, David Byrne, and Jean-Michel Basquiat, all of whomalong with untold othersowe a debt to the bizarre wartime escapades of the Dada vanguard.<br><br>A globe-spanning narrative that resurrects some of the 20th century&#x2019;s most influential artistic figures,<i>Destruction Was My Beatrice</i> describes how Dada burst upon the world in the midst of total warand how the effects of this explosion are still reverberating today.<br></p><p><b>Jed Rasula</b> is the Helen S. Lanier Distinguished Professor of English at the University of Georgia. The author of several scholarly works on literature and modernism, as well as two books of poetry, he lives in Athens, Georgia.<br>"New York Times Book Review" Editors' Choice <br>"Wall Street Journal"<br> Detailed and entertaining.... Mr. Rasula captures the madcap history of this movement, born in one war and dissolved by another. The first group history of Dada, "Destruction Is My Beatrice" draws on letters and memoirs in several languages and archival debris from the cities to which the movement spread. <br>"New York Times Book Review"<br> Rasula uncovers why Dada didn t expire along with the isms it either spawned or incorporated.... One of [his] insights is to reveal Dada s kinship to jazz, and thus to the specifically American modernist outlook that blossomed throughout the century but was more acceptable in Europe than in its birthplace ... [a] meticulous investigation. <br>"The Economist"<br> An eloquent new history. <br>"Washington Post"<br> Excellent and comprehensive.... Rasula handles his deeply researched material fluidly. He harnesses many fine details and puts them in a larger context. The result is a book that ultimately humanizes what might seem like a senseless and antagonistic period of art history. <br>"Daily Beast"<br> It s quite a feat to recapture the thrill of a century-old cultural insurgency, but Jed Rasula pulls it off with gusto in "Destruction Was My Beatrice," a marvelous history of the non-art non-movement that dynamited complacency and conventionality across Europe and across the Atlantic in New York for a few heady years during and after World War I. Rasula enfolds Dada s inconsistencies and eccentricities in a lover s embrace while treating its key people, publications, exhibitions, and events to the informed assessment of a scholar. <br>Los Angeles Review of Books<br> Rasula s brilliant work of art history tells the story of the people, places, and ideas of Dada, and its long-lasting impact on our world.... Rasula s primary goal is to place Dada in an artistic and political context, but beauty and fun were as much a part of the movement as its history, and so it is only fitting that the author include fun and beauty in his prose. Nonetheless, an art movement without the art is just a party therefore the historian must also be a critic, interpreting as well as narrating for his reader. And Rasula as a critic is Rasula at his best. Without Rasula s insightful perspective on the work, the story of Dada would have all the significance of barroom braggadocio, but he shows how the movement revalued the possibilities of art in the world. <br>"Pittsburgh Post-Gazette"<br> Well researched and engagingly written. <br>"Brooklyn Rail"<br> Adroitly weaving historical and cultural analysis with engaging cosmopolitan anecdotes, Rasula has created a big, rich, amiably peopled work of art history that also happens to be as entertaining as a novel. This is not to slight its academic rigor; rather, "Destruction" is that rare bird of scholarly work that is both impeccably researched and compulsively readable, a bona fide page-turner that isn t afraid to show off its erudition. <br>Shelf Awareness<br> [An] insightful contribution to art history.... Filled with fascinating details and memorable personalities. A thoroughly enjoyable and accessible history of Dada. <br>"Library Journal"<br> This comprehensive study covers everything from the irreverence of the art and performances to fights among key players. [A] detailed look into the rise and fall of Dada. <br>"Publishers Weekly"<br> Rasula s focus on Francis Picabia and Kurt Schwitters covers new ground in addition to illustrating how well-known artists such as Man Ray, Max Ernst, and Marcel Duchamp fit into the collective movement. The book is also a fascinating history of place, as it traces the spread of Dada from the cabarets of Switzerland to the cafes of Paris, art fairs of Berlin, and galleries of New York. This accessible yet rigorous and comprehensive study outlines the history of a movement whose irreverence and inventiveness still influence our world today. <br>"Kirkus Reviews"<br> This comprehensive study of artists, exhibits, writings, and events is a heady trip.... A well-researched survey that shows the scope of Dada and its influence on the art world. <br>Greil Marcus, author of "Lipstick Traces"<br> 'Only imbeciles and Spanish professors care about dates, ' Hans Arp once wrote about Dada. Jed Rasula knows about dates, but unlike so many, he feels Dada on his skin. He writes and thinks from inside this crystallization of modernism, and he can follow its light anywhere. <br>Geoffrey O Brien, author of "Sonata for Jukebox" and "Stolen Glimpses, Captive Shadows"<br> Jed Rasula s mercurial curiosity and awesome erudition make him the ideal guide to that brief, mysterious moment when Dada became an international phenomenon whose provocations continue to reverberate. The exhilarating collaborations and equally frequent conflicts among a cast of amazing personalities make for a compelling and eye-opening narrative. <br>Anne-Marie O Connor, author of "The Lady in Gold: The Extraordinary Tale of Gustav Klimt s Masterpiece, Portrait of Adele Bloch-Bauer"<br> A fascinating, splendidly detailed portrait of an era when poems and paintings mattered, vividly peopled by the stars of the incendiary artistic movement whose liberating legacy can be felt in the work of everyone from T.S. Eliot and James Joyce to the Beatles and Talking Heads. In an art world overshadowed by celebrity brands and market valuations, Jed Rasula allows us to relive a moment when artists promised to be thoroughly new and inventive and rewrite life every day. <br>Marjorie Perloff, author of "The Futurist Moment: Avant-Garde, Avant-Guerre, and the Language of Rupture"<br> Dada: a familiar word we all toss around. But who were the Dadaists really? What did they accomplish? How did Dada relate to other avant-garde movements like Constructivism? Was Dada a historical phenomenon or is it a state of mind? The great feat of Jed Rasula s extraordinarily lively and compelling narrative is to defamiliarize Dada so that we see its evolution as if for the first time. A genuinely delightful book! <br>Francis M. Naumann, curator and author of "The Recurrent, Haunting Ghost: Essays on the Art, Life and Legacy of Marcel Duchamp"<br> An informative, lively, and entertaining narrative of Dada. A virtual biography of an enormously influential art movement on the 100th anniversary of its birth. <br>Timothy O. Benson, Curator, Robert Gore Rifkind Center for German Expressionist Studies, Los Angeles County Museum of Art<br> A readable narrative that rejoices in the spirit of Dada s fleeting existence, never alighting on the precast definitions that have often shackled previous explanations. Rasula brings the Dadaists to life in vivid accounts of their interactions, aspirations, mishaps, and triumphs. <br>"</p><h2>The Mystery of Easter (Lent/Easter)</h2><p>What does the paschal mystery mean in the context of the rite - past and present - and in Christian life and death?Students of the liturgy and preachers will find in these pages a thoughtful examination of the mystery of Easter.

We all did.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>My father was an electrician in Santa Monica, but he had a hard time finding a job up here. It&#x2019;s almost impossible to get work on account of the Depression. I don&#x2019;t understand exactly what the Depression is except it has to do with the banks collapsing and people not having money. The only job my father could get was as a guard and an electrician in the prison. Everybody likes him here, though, so he was promoted to assistant warden.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Since Nat&#x2019;s been at the Esther P.

If my dad hasn&#x2019;t told her, I&#x2019;m certainly not going to.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Outside, I trudge past the guard tower, which is a tiny room on three-story-tall metal legs. All the firepower on the island is up in the towers and in the gun galleries. An armed guard down with the convicts can be jumped, ambushed, taken down. But when a guard is up high with his gun trained on us, we&#x2019;re all safe. Or as safe as we can be on a twelve-acre rock with kidnappers, con men, hit men, bank robbers, criminals, crooks, murderers, and maybe an assassin or two.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I walk up the steep switchback to the top of the island, which really stinks. Alcatraz is the world&#x2019;s biggest bird toilet; plus there are three hundred and fifty prisoner toilets up here.

This new context calls for a consideration of the liturgical character and setting of the Lectionary readings. <i>Preaching the New Lectionary: Year A</i> offers readers that interpretation.</p> <p><i>Preaching the New Lectionary</i> is unique. First, it employs a literary-liturgical way of interpreting all the readings of each Sunday and major feast of the liturgical year, including the often overlooked responsorial psalm. Second, it explicitly situates the interpretation of each day within the theology of its respective liturgical season. This theology is drawn from the specific themes of the readings that comprise that particular year rather than from more general themes associated with the season. The meaning of the entire season becomes the context for understanding the individual parts of it. Third, the lections are also read in sequential order from the first Sunday of that season to the last. This reading interprets the function of the literary forms, thus providing yet another way of interpreting the riches of the readings.</p> <p>This way of reading and understanding the Lectionary has potential for many forms of liturgical ministry. It can quicken the religious imagination of homilists, thus providing fresh new possibilities for liturgical preaching. It offers creative insights for those involved in the liturgical preparation for the celebration of feasts and seasons. It can also act as a valuable resource for liturgical catechesis. The material in <i>Preaching the New Lectionary</i> contributes toward enhancing the liturgical lives of the faithful.</p> <p><i>Dianne Bergant, CSA, is Professor of Old Testament studies at Catholic Theological Union in Chicago.

Ironstone (A Schiffer Book for Collectors)</h2><p>This authoritative reference work identifies thousands of marks from American, English and European potters. In the main body of the text, the marks are presented by potter in alphabetical order. Included in each potter&#39;s listing is the location of the firm, a brief history of the company, the span of years from the firm&#39;s establishment until its dissolution, and any former and subsequent company affiliations associated with that firm. The marks associated with that potter are presented in chronological order. Also provided are listings of further readings for those wishing either to delve deeper into the history of the firm or to view images of wares upon which these marks appear. American and Canadian importers, and the potters for whom they imported wares, are also identified. In addition, numerous appendices provide future information pertaining to ware types and printed patterns produced by the various potters, registry dates, and much more. A glossary of pottery terms and an extensive bibliography round out the presentation. This encyclopedia, years in the making, provides the most current research on potters spanning two hundred years and is the essential reference for everyone interested in ceramics.</p><p>Arnold A. Kowalsky has been a serious ceramics researcher for many years. He is also a dealer in Flow Blue ceramics. He and his wife Dorothy, who entered every listing for this encyclopedia into the computer, live in New York.The title of this book pretty much sums up its contents. It features listings of a variety of marks associated with each pottery firm, the location of the firms, and their history and dates of operation. The same "Marks Numbering System" devised by Geoffrey A. Godden, the reigning expert on British pottery, is continued for each entry in this book (the book is, in fact, dedicated to Godden and includes an introduction by him as well). In addition, there are numerous appendixes that list, for example, patterns of each firm in alphabetical order, major importers, merchants, and auctioneers specializing in earthenwares in the United States and Canada; a glossary of pottery terms and separate indexes for English, continental, and American potters. Although the book's coverage of "European" potters' marks (as opposed to English potters and their marks) is limited to just 22 pages--slightly more than 20 different potters--this is nonetheless a valuable reference tool and would be a useful addition to most public libraries and all specialized art libraries.<br><i>-Margarete Gross, Chicago P.L. </i><br>Copyright 1999 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>Mattie&#39;s Pledge: A Novel (Journey to Pleasant Prairie)</h2><p><b>A Tender, Poignant, and Heartwarming Glimpse into the Amish Migration West from Pennsylvania<br></b><br>Mattie Schrock is no stranger to uprooting her life.

When the sound began to die down on its own, he lowered his arms&#x2014;giving the impression the sound had fallen on his command. &#x201c;A place for Humans,&#x201d; he continued, &#x201c;where we will not be tempted by the di&#x2019;Taykan. Where we will not be forced to live among those who use their bodies as licentious tools of conquest!&#x201d;</p><p>Most of the di&#x2019;Taykan Torin knew would laugh themselves sick at the phrase &#x201c;licentious tools of conquest.&#x201d; Taykans in the di phase were undeniably the most sexually indiscriminate species in known space, but when it came to conquest, a smarter man than Varga would remember that they&#x2019;d only barely managed to broker a planet-wide peace&#x2014;a peace enforced by half a dozen heavily armed satellites&#x2014;when the Elder Races made first contact. And they&#x2019;d been as happy as Humans had when given a chance to apply their knowledge of war to the Confederation&#x2019;s engagement with the Primacy.</p><p>&#x201c;A place where we will not live under the threat of the Krai&#x2019;s unnatural appetites!&#x201d;</p><p>As the Krai&#x2019;s appetites weren&#x2019;t unnatural to the Krai, Torin thought <i>all</i>-<i>encompassing appetites</i> would have been a better description; although Varga wasn&#x2019;t particularly concerned with either accuracy or overt speciesisms. In fairness, even Torin found it a bit disturbing that the Krai considered Humans to be the tastiest thing on the menu&#x2014;or would, had not a number of very explicit laws been put in place.</p><p>&#x201c;We were there when the Elder Races needed us.&#x201d; The fingers of both hands curled into fists, Varga shifted into an exaggerated fighting stance. &#x201c;We fought in their war!&#x201d;</p><p>Torin gritted her teeth and mirrored the reactions of the men and women around her who were stomping, howling, and forgetting that Varga had never been a part of the military <i>we</i>. Had never fought. Had never watched friends blown to pieces by Primacy artillery or seen them bleed out too fast to save. Had she not already been under orders, Torin would&#x2019;ve taken him down for that lie alone.</p><p>Three years ago, Varga had been a less-than-successful actor who found his natural stage when he&#x2019;d joined Human&#x2019;s First. When he&#x2019;d realized that true belief wasn&#x2019;t as important as discontent and a willingness to blindly follow rhetoric, his rise to the top of the organization had turned a whiny fringe group with a misplaced apostrophe into an armed force. He&#x2019;d gone looking for Humans trained to violence by the Navy or the Corps and unwilling or unable to settle into the peace of civilian life, then he&#x2019;d layered the new shape of the organization around them.</p><p>Human&#x2019;s First had stopped being a distasteful example of the Confederation&#x2019;s belief in free speech and had become a threat when they took over the small station orbiting Denrest and killed the station crew, three of them the Humans they were supposedly putting first as well four di&#x2019;Taykan, whose small freighter they stole after dumping the bodies out the lock. It wasn&#x2019;t entirely clear if they&#x2019;d taken a shuttle up from Denrest or if they&#x2019;d had Susumi capabilities before they&#x2019;d taken the station, but they definitely had them after, opening up all of known space.</p><p>Then they took another small station, another ship.</p><p>And another.</p><p>Having watched him in action for over two tendays, Torin would bet her pension Varga had referred to the dead as collateral damage.</p><p>&#x201c;We have done their dirty work, and what has it got us?&#x201d; he demanded.</p><p>The old garage, long empty of drills and excavators, rang with variations on <i>sweet fuk all.</i> The communication unit implanted into the bone of her jaw pinged twice short and fast. A heartbeat later, once more. Her people were on the move and not a moment too soon. Torin touched her tongue to the pressure point just long enough to make the ping distinct, snarled at the sallow-faced, young man who&#x2019;d just stomped on her foot, and let the motion of the crowd carry her away from him toward the wall.</p><p>A tall, thin man, hair and beard gone naturally gray, stood in the half circle of upper echelon behind Varga on the dais, his eyes locked on his slate. He might have been checking on his kids&#x2014;there were, unfortunately, no laws preventing assholes from breeding&#x2014;but Torin&#x2019;s intell said he was monitoring the crowd&#x2019;s comm traffic, his own implant slaved to the slate. Implants significantly improved the odds of veterans finding civilian employment, so both officers and NCOs kept their military comm units when they left the service even though nonmilitary techs charged an arm and a leg for upkeep. Both legs if they had to crack the bone. Given the size of the crowd, Torin estimated another ten to fifteen implants in the garage creating sufficient background noise to hide her team&#x2019;s coordinating pings.</p><p>Or the fraction of her team acceptable to Human&#x2019;s First aggressive recruiting. Ryder. Mashona. Her.</p><p>Today, new recruits mixed with old hands in an abandoned mining facility on the dark side of a small moon, in the old heavy machinery garage that smelled of sulfur and sweat, having their stores of meaningless rhetoric topped up.</p><p>&#x201c;No more&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; The crowd around Torin quieted as Varga dropped his voice to a conversational level. She settled into the same expectant stillness, although her expectations were entirely different. &#x201c;No more will the Elder Races keep us from what is rightfully ours. Humans first!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;HUMANS FIRST! HUMANS FIRST! HUMANS FIRST!&#x201d;</p><p><i>At least they drop the apostrophe when they&#x2019;re chanting.</i> Torin covered the last three meters to the open decompression hatch, stepped over the lower lip, and out into an access tunnel that had clearly been a part of the old mine. She drew in a deep lungful of air and said with complete sincerity, &#x201c;Stinks like the latrines after burrito night in there. I need to breathe a bit.&#x201d;</p><p>She found it interesting that Varga&#x2019;s security stood facing the garage rather than down the tunnel. Had been facing the garage before Torin had moved toward the hatch. Varga was clearly smart enough to realize he hadn&#x2019;t built stability into his organization.</p><p>At 1.8 meters, Torin wasn&#x2019;t small, but the woman standing with impressive arms folded and a scowl that told Torin she&#x2019;d made master corporal, at least, before leaving the Corps topped her by a good 15 centimeters. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t wander off,&#x201d; she growled.</p><p>Torin tongued her implant, grinned, and said, &#x201c;Wouldn&#x2019;t think of it.&#x201d;</p><p>The guard&#x2019;s scowl shifted to a frown.</p><p>First ping back.</p><p>&#x201c;Think you&#x2019;re smart, eh? You can&#x2019;t be hanging around out here.&#x201d;</p><p>The double ping back removed the need for Torin to respond.</p><p>Eyes locked on the guard&#x2019;s face, Torin lunged forward, driving her fist into the other woman&#x2019;s solar plexus, her weight behind the blow. &#x201c;Actually, I can be,&#x201d; she muttered, turned, and hauled the hatch closed to the sound of a large body hitting the floor and flopping a bit, the guard&#x2019;s ability to give the alarm reduced to a barely audible wheeze.</p><p>Years of neglect had nearly rusted the locking wheel into place. Using the heel of her hand, Torin slammed it left, then right. Metal ground against metal and red-brown flakes drifted toward the floor.</p><p>Left. Then right.</p><p>Left.</p><p>Then all the way right. The battens slid home into the cleats on either side of the hatch.</p><p>The problem inherent in turning people into a mob was that, at some point, they had to be gathered together and people crowded into an area with limited access were inherently vulnerable. Control the access; control the space.</p><p>First ping.</p><p>Torin tongued her implant and dropped to one knee, checking the guard&#x2019;s diaphragm spasms had stopped when she&#x2019;d lost consciousness. Labored but regular breathing suggested they had, so Torin hooked a thumbnail over the end of the zip-tie hidden in the outer seam of her military surplus trousers and yanked it free. Woven from Mictok webbing, the zip-ties were undetectable and unbreakable. Torin&#x2019;d had to call in a few favors to get them, but she didn&#x2019;t use plastic with another option available. The guard&#x2019;s wrists secured, she pulled another zip-tie from the inner seam of the same leg, looping it around and through crossed ankles.</p><p>No implant. Torin let the guard&#x2019;s mouth close and scrubbed her thumb against her sleeve. Trust the idiots who misplaced apostrophes to think size meant security.</p><p>Double ping.</p><p>Three of the garage&#x2019;s four hatches had been dogged down. Yet to be closed were the old loading doors behind the dais; the moment Varga noticed something was up, he&#x2019;d be out them faster than Havarti through a H&#x2019;san. Unfortunately, with the crowd staring directly at those doors, they had to be closed last.</p><p>Through speakers mounted along the roof of the tunnel, she could hear Varga listing everything Humans had been denied. Where <i>Humans</i> equaled Richard Varga. It was a long list. Sooner rather than later, one of his less reflective followers would get bored, decide it was a good time to hit the shitter, and discover they couldn&#x2019;t leave.</p><p>Torin raced for the fourth door, reached a T-junction, made a hard right&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>Ten meters away, three men stood outside the big doors; three large men armed with black-market&#x2013;acquired Marine Corps KC-7s. Guarding Varga&#x2019;s back.</p><p>The paranoid bastard.</p><p>Given the way they filled the space, she could hear more than she could see Binti Mashana charging in from the opposite end of the tunnel.</p><p>Two of the guards turned toward Torin, the third turned the other way. All three raised their weapons and the largest of the three, a man with his beard divided into two braids, barked, &#x201c;Hold it right there! Both of you.&#x201d;</p><p>Torin smiled and kept running. At the other end of the tunnel, Mashona picked up speed.</p><p>&#x201c;I said, hold it right there!&#x201d;</p><p>When an approaching enemy declined to <i>hold it right there</i>, the correct response was to pull the trigger, not repeat a command already ignored. Of course, they couldn&#x2019;t be positive Torin was an enemy; she could have been one of Varga&#x2019;s people in a hurry to get somewhere, but it was still sloppy work. Torin decided to take that personally as the weapons raised the odds that all three of this lot were ex-Corps. Everyone in the Corps, regardless of specialty, trained first on the KC-7.</p><p>She ducked under the barrel of the raised KC without slowing and hit Bearded Guard at the waist, her shoulder driving deep into a layer of fat over muscle. He grunted, folded, and went down, crashing into the guard behind him hard enough to drop him to the floor as well. In her peripheral vision, she saw Mashona grab the muzzle of the third weapon, point it at the ceiling, and aim her knuckles at the windpipe of the man holding it.</p><p>Her weight on Bearded Guard&#x2019;s chest enough to keep him temporarily on the floor, Torin grabbed the barrel of his KC, yanked it out of his grip, and swung it one-handed at the second guard who&#x2019;d made it back up onto his knees. The butt slammed into his jaw with a crack of metal against bone and he went down again.</p><p>She jerked back in time to avoid a fist aimed at her nose, the blow glancing off her mouth instead, hard enough to slam her lower lip into her teeth, splitting the soft flesh. Mouth filling with blood, Torin rose up, dropped, and felt a rib give way under her knee.</p><p>Bearded Guard bellowed. Torin spat blood in his face.</p><p>The crack of a fired KC echoed in the enclosed tunnel, overlapping the high-pitched buzz of two ricochets and a grunt of pain Torin barely heard over the ringing in her ears. Early on in the war, it had been discovered that the more complicated and high tech the weapon, the easier it was for the opposing side to fuk with it from a distance. A contained chemical explosion propelling a piece of metal at high speed out a rifled tube could only be fukked up by the person firing it.</p><p>She couldn&#x2019;t tell who&#x2019;d been hit.</p><p>&#x201c;Mashona?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dipshit here had his finger on the trigger&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Mashona wrapped profanity around the muted thud of fist against softer flesh. &#x201c;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. and shot himself in the leg. Apparently, he slept through&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d; Two fast blows. &#x201c;&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. Lieutenant Cole&#x2019;s lecture on trigger discipline.&#x201d;</p><p><i>Discipline</i> dropped into silence. The list of Varga&#x2019;s grievances had stopped blaring out of the speaker over the door.</p><p>All five combatants froze for a single heartbeat.</p><p>Torin braced herself against the sudden roar of sound from inside the garage.</p><p>&#x201c;Gunny, they heard the shot!&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Lock it up, I&#x2019;ll deal with this.&#x201d; Torin blocked an elbow with her forearm and rolled up onto her feet as Mashona dove for the door. She kicked Bearded Guard just above the curve of his gut, hard enough he lost interest in anything but puking and choking on it, both arms holding his rib cage together.</p><p>Ignoring the blood soaking into his pant leg, Mashona&#x2019;s Dipshit pulled a knife from a boot sheath. Torin bent away from his first swing, spun around to his bad side&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.</p><p>&#x201c;Gunny! Door&#x2019;s stuck!&#x201d;</p><p>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;then kicked him in the thigh, driving the toe of her boot into the bullet hole. He howled with pain as his leg collapsed under him and was smart enough to yell for backup before he lunged at her again.</p><p>This one was <i>definitely</i> ex-Corps.</p><p>Catching his blade in the trigger guard of the KC, Torin twisted it out of his hand, continued the movement around behind him, and got an arm around his neck and choked him out with the strap.</p><p>&#x201c;Gunny!&#x201d;</p><p>Rusted hinges had jammed one of the big double doors with twelve centimeters still to close. A scuffed boot stuck out through the space by the floor and two, no, three sets of fingers emerged farther up. Torin slammed the muzzle of the KC into the shin above the boot&#x2014;hard enough to break the skin and invoke a stream of impressive profanity&#x2014;then she used the butt of the weapon on the reaching fingers. As they disappeared to slightly less impressive profanity&#x2014;probably ex-Navy&#x2014;she threw her weight against the pitted steel, her shoulder next to Mashona&#x2019;s, and together they managed to move it far enough for the three big canted, coiled spring latches to finally snap into place.</p><p>The background roar from the speakers grew louder while over it a familiar voice demanded they open the doors immediately. Or else.</p><p>&#x201c;Does he honestly think he&#x2019;s still in charge?&#x201d; Mashona wondered.</p><p>&#x201c;He thinks Human&#x2019;s First has an apostrophe.&#x201d; Torin spat out another mouthful of blood, checked the magazine of the weapon she held, tossed it to Mashona, and bent to pick up the other two as Varga began listing the ways they&#x2019;d pay when he got out.</p><p>Lifting one of the second guard&#x2019;s arms into the air, her fingers dark bands around his pale, grubby wrist, Mashona shook her head. &#x201c;Gunny, I don&#x2019;t think this one&#x2019;s going anywhere.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Is he dead?&#x201d; Varga had trusted these three with weapons at his back, so she&#x2019;d be willing to bet they&#x2019;d been among those who&#x2019;d attacked the stations and killed noncombatants. Torin wouldn&#x2019;t mourn if she&#x2019;d taken one out when taking him down, although the Wardens would be pissed. Again.</p><p>&#x201c;No. But&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If he&#x2019;s alive, secure him. There&#x2019;s three of us against everyone else on this moon; if we sideline someone, I want them to stay out.&#x201d; She rolled Bearded Guard up onto his side so he could breathe, cracked ribs topside. Then, avoiding the spreading puddle of vomit, she got out the zip-ties.</p></p><h2>Facts and Fascism</h2><p>&#34;This book names the most powerful forces in Europe which organized the Fascist and Nazi parties and movement, the powerful American forces which own, control and subsidize native Fascism, and the spokesmen, radio orators, writers and other agents of reaction in America.&#34; Facts and Fascism is the definitive account and source book on Fascism in the United States after the First World War and on into the Second. No doubt every subsequent work on this explosive topic owes a great debt to this original research. By crusading investigative journalist George Seldes, the book is in three parts: 1) The Big Money and Big Profits in Fascism, 2) Native Fascist Forces, and 3) Our Press as a Fascist Force. The first part reveals the backing of U.S. and British big business behind the rise of Fascism and militarism, with chapters on Germany, Italy, Japan, and Spain, the Nazi cartels and the National Association of Manufacturers. The author was a reporter in Italy in the early 20&#39;s as Fascism got its start, and wrote a full-length, critical portrait of Mussolini. In &#34;Native Fascist Forces,&#34; Seldes first tells the story of the botched putsch by J. P. Morgan and the American Legion against FDR in 1934 - surely one of the most hushed-up episodes in US history. Next Seldes dissects the Ford empire&#39;s support for Nazism and its repressive, even murderous labor practices, and Nazi apologists like Lindbergh, Father Coughlin and the Reader&#39;s Digest. The third part explores and deplores acts of treason by war-profiteering heavy industry and by the major newspaper chains. He exposes their habit of faking news for their political agenda, going back to the 1850&#39;s in support of black slavery, and white servitude - that is, with attacks on labor and social justice. The last chapter discusses profiteering from a different form of slavery, the tobacco addiction. Among the appendices is one on the definition of Fascism, and data on Who Owns America - thirteen plutocratic families.</p><p></p><h2>Short Fiction of Flann O&#39;Brien (Irish Literature)</h2><p><p>This riotous collection at last gathers together an expansive selection of Flann O'Brien's shorter fiction in a single volume, as well as O'Brien's last and unfinished novel, "Slattery's Sago Saga." Also included are new translations of several stories originally published in Irish, and other rare pieces. With some of these stories appearing here in book form for the very first time, and others previously unavailable for decades, "Short Fiction" is a welcome gift for every Flann O'Brien fan worldwide.</p></p><p>Flann O&#39;Brien, whose real name was Brian O&#39;Nolan, also wrote under the pen name of Myles na Gopaleen. He was born in 1911 in County Tyrone. A resident of Dublin, he graduated from University College after a brilliant career as a student (editing a magazine called Blather) and joined the Civil Service, in which he eventually attained a senior position. He wrote throughout his life, which ended in Dublin on April 1, 1966. His other novels include The Dalkey Archive, The Third Policeman, The Hard Life, and The Poor Mouth, all available from Dalkey Archive Press. Also available are three volumes of his newspaper columns: The Best of Myles, Further Cuttings from Cruiskeen Lawn, and At War.Starred Review. Irish late modernist writer O&#39;Brien (The Third Policeman, At Swim Two Birds, The Poor Mouth) wrote in Gaelic under the name Brian � Nuall�in, and in English as Brother Barnabus, Myles na gCopaleen, Lir O&#39;Connor, and Brian Nolan, among others. This present collection contains work from many of these known pseudonymns, with Gaelic stories in translation, as well as the unfinished novel, Slattery&#39;s Sago Saga. The variety taken together displays a playful, sardonic voice that is charmingly self-conscious in its invention. In &#34;Scenes in a Novel,&#34; for instance, O&#39;Brien&#39;s narrator is an author who must reckon with the rebellious characters of a novel he is writing, particularly his anti-hero Carruthers McDaid, &#34;a man...created one night when had swallowed nine stouts and vaguely blasphemous.&#34; The story &#34;Two in One&#34; is narrated by Murphy, a taxidermist&#39;s assistant who attempts to hide the murder of his boss by wearing the deceased&#39;s skin, eventually fusing with it, only to be imprisoned for the crime of killing himself. Mirroring his own ambiguous approach to identity, a myriad cast of characters and voices seem to all jostle for attention, delightful in their assurance that &#34;ot everything in story is as unbelievable as it may seem.&#34; (Aug.)</p><h2>Nuclear Transmutation: The Reality of Cold Fusion</h2><p>The announcement of cold fusion in March 1989 at the University of Utah was greeted with astonishment worldwide. Drs. Martin Fleischmann and Stanley Pons had claimed that an electrochemical cell with heavy water electrolyte and a palladium cathode gave rise to so much excess energy that the mysterious phenomenon had to be nuclear, and was probably a process related to nuclear fusion. Many scientists quickly took sides for or against cold fusion--mostly against. By the end of the summer the experts claimed cold fusion didn&#39;t exist. They said it was an experimental error and could not be reproduced. Actually, the story had barely begun. Provocative research had never ended. Cold fusion was and is very much alive. IN THIS BOOK, Dr. Mizuno describes both the dark and bright sides of the cold fusion story: the frustration, the boredom, the endless guerrilla war with scientists who wanted to stop the research, science journalists who appeared to thrive on the outpouring of supposedly negative results, fruitless battles to publish a paper or be heard at a physics conference, but then also the triumph of dramatic experimental results in the production of huge excess energy and the paradigm busting discovery of the low-energy transmutation of heavy elements found on cold fusion electrodes. It is impossible for one book to encompass the now expanding worldwide effort to understand the cold fusion enigma, but for those who want to learn about the rest of the story, this account of one scientist&#39;s experience on the frontiers of knowledge is an excellent beginning.</p><p>Tadahiko Mizuno was born in Asahigawa City, Hokkaido, Japan in 1945. He graduated from the Department of Applied Physics, College of Engineering, Hokkaido National University in 1968. In 1973 he received his Ph.D. in applied physics. Among his achievements in cold fusion were the first extensive reports of neutron measurements in Japan, pioneering work on loaded, solid-state proton conductors, and key new studies of transmutation products. Presently, he is an Assistant Professor of Nuclear Engineering, College of Engineering, Hokkaido University.Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: Japanese</p><h2>Chicago Poems: Unabridged (Dover Thrift Editions)</h2><p><p><i>Chicago Poems</i> (1916) was Carl Sandburg's first-published book of verse.

Around the world, they make their livings through touch, closeness, and personal care. Their labors, both paid and unpaid, sustain the day-to-day work that we require to survive. This book takes a close look at carework, domestic work, and sex work in everyday life and illuminates the juncture where money and intimacy meet. Intimate labor is presented as a comprehensive category of investigation into gender, race, class, and other power relations in the context of global economic transformations. In chronicling the history of intimate labor in light of the rise and devolution of welfare states, women&#39;s workforce participation, family formation, the expansion of sex work into new industries, and the development of institutions for dependent people, this wide-ranging reader advances debates over the relationship between care and economy.</p><p>Eileen Boris is Hull Professor and Chair of Feminist Studies at the University of California, Santa Barbara, where she directs the Center for Research on Women and Social Justice. Rhacel Salazar Parre�as is Professor of American Civilization and Sociology at Brown University."In this exciting new volume, Boris and Parre�as bring together a collection of cutting-edge research on the many surprising ways we daily&#x2015;mix, split, stir&#x2015;money with intimate life. Sex workers who sell the girlfriend experience. Sperm and egg donors who give a gift and do it for money. Clients who struggle against the concept of a servant, a nanny, a housekeeper, but also need one. Each encounter with the market raises subtle yet important issues for social theory and everyday life. Were all living it; this book helps us understand it." (Arlie Hochschild <i>author of <i>The Managed Heart</i> and <i>The Commercialization of Intimate Life</i></i>)<br><br>"This volume's ingenious focus on intimate labor encompasses a fascinating range of activities, from egg donation to end-of-life care, from child care to sex work. <i>Intimate Labors</i> makes an extremely valuable contribution to feminist theorizing on care work and reproductive labor by providing fresh insights on the lives of intimate laborers, as well as on the impact of race, gender, and sexuality in the context of globalization." (Dorothy Roberts <i>Northwestern University, author of <i>Killing the Black Body: Race, Reproduction, and The Meaning of Liberty</i></i>)<br><br>"The selection of articles, and in particular the combination of paid and unpaid forms of intimate labour, will make a useful contribution to global labour studies. The book is a gateway to understanding how intimacy and labour organize themselves in both formal and informal social structures. In addition, it illustrates the ways in which intimacy has become linked with issues of ethnicity, sexuality, race, class, and other power relations in the context of globalization as well as continued socio-political and economic transformations." (Marina de Regt)<br><br>"This collection represents a stellar interdisciplinary contribution to research on work shaped by personal and emotional interaction. The essays included embody the best quality of the work they explore&#x2015;a thoughtful and discerning sensitivity to human need." (Nancy Folbre)<br><br>"Eileen Boris and Rhacel Salazar Parrenas's <i>Intimate Labors: Cultures, Technologies, and the Politics of Care</i> is an excellent read and resource for those of us in the field of labor studies. . . I highly recommend this book to anyone engaged in organizing and educating care workers. It is well written, is thought provoking, and challenges us to understand the definition of intimate labor and how it functions in a neoliberal marketplace. In an economy increasingly dependent on intimate labor, this is a must-read volume of essays." (Emily E. LaBarbera Twarog <i><i>Labor Studies Journal</i></i>)</p><h2>Whittaker Chambers: A Biography</h2><p><b>Whittaker Chambers</b> is the first biography of this complex and enigmatic figure. Drawing on dozens of interviews and on materials from forty archives in the United States and abroad--including still-classified KGB dossiers--Tanenhaus traces the remarkable journey that led Chambers from a sleepy Long Island village to center stage in America's greatest political trial and then, in his last years, to a unique role as the godfather of post-war conservatism. This biography is rich in startling new information about Chambers's days as New York's "hottest literary Bolshevik"; his years as a Communist agent and then defector, hunted by the KGB; his conversion to Quakerism; his secret sexual turmoil; his turbulent decade at Time magazine, where he rose from the obscurity of the book-review page to transform the magazine into an oracle of apocalyptic anti-Communism. But all this was a prelude to the memorable events that began in August 1948, when Chambers testified against Alger Hiss in the spy case that changed America. <b>Whittaker Chambers</b> goes far beyond all previous accounts of the Hiss case, re-creating its improbably twists and turns, and disentangling the motives that propelled a vivid cast of characters in unpredictable directions. <br><br>A rare conjunction of exacting scholarship and narrative art, <b>Whittaker Chambers</b> is a vivid tapestry of 20th century history.</p><p>A coolly objective look at the most controversial figure in the postwar crusade against American Communists. Whittaker Chambers (1901-61) made headlines in 1948 with his sensational accusation that former State Department official Alger Hiss was not only a Communist, but a spy, charges Hiss denied until his death in 1996. This scrupulously evenhanded biography concludes that Chambers told the truth, even as it pitilessly delineates his tortured family background, anguished sexual confusion, and political ruthlessness, which might well prompt doubts about his trustworthiness. Chambers&#39; life makes a perfect case study of the most morally fraught period in American history.<b>Sam Tanenhaus</b> was the editor of both&nbsp;<i>The New York Times Book Review&nbsp;</i>and the Week in Review section of <i>The New York&nbsp;Times.&nbsp;</i>From 1999 to 2004 he was a contributing editor at<i>&nbsp;Vanity Fair</i>, where he wrote often on politics. His work has also appeared in&nbsp;<i>The New York Times Magazine, The New Republic, The New York Review of Books,</i>&nbsp;and many other publications. Tanenhaus&#x2019;s book&nbsp;<i>Whittaker Chambers: A Biography</i>&nbsp;won the&nbsp;<i>Los Angeles Times </i>Book Prize&nbsp;and was a finalist for both the National Book Award and the Pulitzer Prize.</p><h2>Mississippi Praying: Southern White Evangelicals and the Civil Rights Movement, 1945-1975</h2><p><p><b>Winner of the 2013 Frank S. and Elizabeth D. Brewer Prize presented by the American Society of Church History</b></p><br><p>Mississippi Praying examines the faith communities at ground-zero of the racial revolution that rocked America. This religious history of white Mississippians in the civil rights era shows how Mississippians&#x2019; intense religious commitments played critical, rather than incidental, roles in their response to the movement for black equality. </p><br><p>During the civil rights movement and since, it has perplexed many Americans that unabashedly Christian Mississippi could also unapologetically oppress its black population. Yet, as Carolyn Ren�e Dupont richly details, white southerners&#x2019; evangelical religion gave them no conceptual tools for understanding segregation as a moral evil, and many believed that God had ordained the racial hierarchy. </p><br><p>Challenging previous scholarship that depicts southern religious support for segregation as weak, Dupont shows how people of faith in Mississippi rejected the religious argument for black equality and actively supported the effort to thwart the civil rights movement. At the same time, faith motivated a small number of white Mississippians to challenge the methods and tactics of do-or-die segregationists. Racial turmoil profoundly destabilized Mississippi&#x2019;s religious communities and turned them into battlegrounds over the issue of black equality. Though Mississippi&#x2019;s evangelicals lost the battle to preserve segregation, they won important struggles to preserve the theology that had sustained the racial hierarchy. Ultimately, this history sheds light on the eventual rise of the religious right by elaborating the connections between the pre- and post-civil rights South.</p></p><p><b>Carolyn Ren�e Dupont</b> is Assistant Professor of History at Eastern Kentucky University in Richmond, KY."Carolyn Renee Duponts examination of Mississippi white evangelicals fervent support of segregation during the 1950s and 1960s offers historians a fresh interpretation of the confounding paradox of God-fearing whites condoning and even participating in massive resistance. [] This book successfully challenges the reader to think beyond a variety of biases inherent in discussion of literatures relationship with ethnic, regional, and national identities." (<i>The Journal of Southern History</i>)<br><br>"Gripping and detailed,Mississippi Prayingtells how the fight to maintain white supremacy was deeply embedded in all the states institutions, particularly its churches. Such a narrative challenges readers to understand how some forms of racism topple, while others yet persist." (<i>Southern Spaces</i>)<br><br>"By examining white Baptist, Methodist, and Presbyterian confrontations with the civil rights movement, Dupont (Eastern Kentucky Univ.) offers a compelling answer to the question of why the most religious state in the US was also its most racist." (E.R. Crowther <i>CHOICE</i>)<br><br>"Duponts prose should be the envy of historians everywhere. Crisp, incisive, and thought-provoking, it moves the reader easily through nine chronological chapters. She draws on powerful examples to make her case, covering everything from Brown v. Board of Education, to the Southern Baptist Conventions conservative reconfiguration, and the splitting of Southern Presbyterians in the 1960s and 1970s." (Marginalia)<br><br>"Dupont's book is an essential companion to any study of the civil rights movement, not only for its treatment of how religion impacted the movements history but also for the way it exposes how easily oppression can be wrapped in a cloak of religiosity that blinds its adherents to injustice occurring all around them." (<i>The Historian</i>)<br><br>"This is an inspired and sparkling religious history of the three major white denominationsSouth Baptists, Presbyterians, and Methodistsin the state of Mississippi for the three decades of the Civil Rights movement...This is notsimply a tale about what happened in the struggle for black equality in Mississippi from 1945 to 1975. It is a mirror, reflecting what is still happening in segregated churches all over America, not just in Mississippi, not just in the South, but all over this great republic." (<i>Baptist History &amp; Heritage</i>)<br><br>"Mississippi Praying helps us better understand how white southerners made sense of their Christian faith and their segregationist practices. Dupont shows how the evangelical faith of many white Mississippians, far from being a source of other worldly escape from the political realm, served as a bulwark in their fight to maintain white supremacy. It is a critical story for properly understanding both the southern civil rights struggle and the history of modern American Christianity." (Joseph Crespino,Emory University)<br><br>"I am grateful to [the author] for further recovering the central role of religion in the civil rights era." (<i>Patheos.com</i>)<br><br>"[...]Dupont has written an intriguing and impassioned book that should stimulate debate." (<i>The American Historical Review</i>)<br><br>"Dupont makes a valuable contribution to the scholarship on the intersection of race and religion by highlighting religion's centrality in the struggle for black equality. Mississippi Praying is must reading for scholars interested in religion, race, and African American studies."

They deal with eternal themes of transition, artifice and, above all, the cruel ravages of time - often depicting flowers, with their heady, perfumed beauty, as the embodiment of decay and desire. Decadent Poetry brings together the works of many fascinating writers - Oscar Wilde on tainted love and the torments of the human spirit, Arthur Symons on an absinthe-induced stupor and the mysteries of the night, Rosamund Marriott Watson on disenchantment and memory, W. B. Yeats on waning passion and faded beauty, Ernest Dowson on lust and despair and Lord Alfred Douglas on shame and secret love, among many others of this exhilarating poetic movement.<br><br>For more than seventy years, Penguin has been the leading publisher of classic literature in the English-speaking world. With more than 1,700 titles, Penguin Classics represents a global bookshelf of the best works throughout history and across genres and disciplines. Readers trust the series to provide authoritative texts enhanced by introductions and notes by distinguished scholars and contemporary authors, as well as up-to-date translations by award-winning translators.</p><p><b>Lisa Rodensky </b>is Assistant Professor of English at Wellesley College, and author of The Crime in Mind (OUP, 2003). .<b>The Harlot's House</b><p>We caught the tread of dancing feet,<br>We loitered down the moonlit street,<br>And stopped beneath the harlot's house.</p><p>Inside, above the din and fray,<br>We heard the loud musicians play<br>The 'Treues Liebes Herz' of Strauss.</p><p>Like strange mechanical grotesques,<br>Making fantasies arabesques,<br>The shadows raced across the blind.</p><p>We watched the ghostly dancers spin<br>To sound of horn and violin,<br>Like black leaves wheeling in the wind.</p><p>Like wire-pulled automatons,<br>Slim silhouetted skeletons<br>Went sidling through the slow quadrille.</p><p>They took each other by the hand,<br>And danced a stately saraband;<br>Their laughter echoed thin and shrill.</p><p>Sometimes a clockwork puppet pressed<br>A phantom lover to her breast,<br>Sometimes they seemed to try to sing.</p><p>Sometimes a horrible marionette<br>Came out, and smoked its cigarette<br>Upon the steps like a live thing.</p><p>Then, turning to my love, I said,<br>'The dead are dancing with the dead,<br>The dust is whirling with the dust.'</p><p>But she &#x2014;she heard the violin,<br>And left my side, and entered in:<br>Love passed into the house of lust.</p><p>Then suddenly the tune went false,<br>The dancers wearied of the waltz,<br>The shadows ceased to wheel and whirl.</p><p>And down the long and silent street,<br>The dawn, with silver-sandalled feet,<br>Crept like a frightened girl.</p><p><b>The Art of Love</b><br><b>Book 1</b></p><p>Should anyone here in Rome lack finesse at love-making,<br>let him<br>Try me&#x2014;read my book; and results are guaranteed!<br>Technique is the secret.

During the 30 years and 135 missions in between, the program experienced triumphs and tragedies, amazed the world with its orbital exploits, and was frequently the subject of admiration, condemnation, pride, and despair. This book provides a detailed overview of the history of winged spacecraft and the development of the vehicle we call the &#34;space shuttle,&#34; and provides a technical description of the orbiter, main engines, external tank, and solid rocket boosters. Two pages are dedicated to each of the 135 missions flown by the American space shuttle, including technical data, crew names, and photos of each mission. The Challenger and Columbia accidents are discussed, along with a discussion of what NASA did to fix the flaws and continue flying. The book concludes by covering the retirement of the vehicle and the delivery of the four remaining orbiters to their final display sites.</p><p>Dennis R. Jenkins worked as a contractor to NASA for 33 years, mostly on the Space Shuttle Program in a variety of engineering and management roles.

John Reiger's work has been hailed as an authoritative look at these early conservationists; now his landmark book is available in an expanded edition that broadens its historic sweep.<br> <br> Beginning in the 1870s, sportsmen across America formed hundreds of organizations that not only fostered responsibility for game habitats but also spearheaded the creation of national parks, forests, and wildlife refuges.

He extends his coverage into the present by demonstrating how the nineteenth-century sportsman's code&#x2014;with its demand for taking responsibility for the total environment&#x2014;continues to be the cornerstone of the sporting ethic. A new Epilogue depicts leading environmental thinker Aldo Leopold as the best-known exponent of this hunter-conservationist ideal.<br> <br> Praised as "one of the seminal works in conservation history" by historian Hal Rothman, Reiger's book continues to be essential reading for all concerned with how earlier Americans regarded the land, demonstrating even to those who oppose hunting that they share with sportsmen and sportswomen an awareness and appreciation of our fragile environment.</p></p><p>We owe the term <i>conservation</i>, in its environmental sense, to Gifford Pinchot, the head of the U.S. Forest Service in Theodore Roosevelt's administration. Having formulated the doctrine of multiple use for the nation's forests, Pinchot asserted that America's renewable resources could be made to last indefinitely so long as a certain amount of natural capital was kept in the bank and managed efficiently.<p> The idea of "conservation," writes historian John Reiger, precedes Pinchot by many years. Its foremost exponents were sport hunters, who had an interest in keeping the wild well stocked with a fresh supply of targets. Acting through organizations such as the Boone and Crockett Club and publications such as <i>Field and Stream</i> and <i>American Sportsman</i>, these hunters advanced a waste-not, want-not ethic that cohered with other conservationist measures, among them the establishment of the first national parks. One of them, George Bird Grinnell, wrote by way of explanation, "No woods, no game; no woods, no water; no water, no fish." That simple message carried, and by the 1880s thousands of hunters had adopted a code of sporting ethics that prohibited wanton, wasteful behavior and encouraged careful attention to the condition of wildlife in the field. Reiger continues the story to the middle years of the 20th century, when the forester Aldo Leopold developed the still-influential "conservation ethic."</p><p> Reiger's book, originally published in 1975 and substantially revised, has become a standard work, and it offers much useful material for students of American environmental history. <i>--Gregory McNamee</i></p>Environmentalists who believe that hunters are interested only in the kill may be surprised to learn that sportsmen were originally in the vanguard of the conservation movement.

With the COBE (Cosmic Background Explorer) project, they showed that the microwave radiation that fills the universe must have come from the Big Bang&#x2014;effectively proving the Big Bang theory beyond any doubt. It was one of the greatest scientific findings of our generation, perhaps of all time. In <i>The Very First Light</i>, John Mather, one of COBE's leaders, and science writer John Boslough tell the story of how it was achieved. A gripping tale of big money, bigger egos, tense politics, and cutting-edge engineering, <i>The Very First Light</i> offers a rare insider's account of the world of big science.</p><p><b>John C. Mather, Ph.D.</b>, is a Senior Astrophysicist in the Observational Cosmology Laboratory at NASA's Goddard Space Flight Center. He won the Nobel Prize in 2006. He is a member of the Astrophysics Subcommittee of the NASA Advisory Committee and of the Standing Review Board for the Kepler project. He lives in Maryland.<p><b>John Boslough</b> received honors in the history of science from Princeton University and has written widely on science for <i>National Geographic</i> and other publications. His previous books include <i>Stephen Hawking's Universe</i> and <i>Masters of Time</i>, co-authored by Wendy W. Cortesi. He lives in Princeton, New Jersey.</p>The Cosmic Background Explorer (COBE) was one of the most successful scientific packages ever launched by NASA; here, the chief project scientist tells its story. COBE was designed to make three delicate measurements of the microwave energy that cosmologists believe to be the last remnant of the Big Bang. Mather and Boslough (a freelance journalist) begin with a quick look at the launching of the satellite, then flash back to cover the scientific background. The Big Bang theory arose from the discovery, early in this century, that distant galaxies are moving away from Earth at high speeds. By the 1940s, scientists had concluded that the universe must have originated in a gigantic explosion, the Big Bang. The greatly cooled energy of that explosion--the cosmic background--was detected in 1964. But the microwave frequencies of the energy were difficult to measure precisely from the surface of the Earth. When NASA put out a call for experiments to be conducted on future satellite launches, the cosmic background measurement was an obvious candidate; NASA eventually combined three proposals into a single project, the COBE. Some 1,600 scientists and technicians would eventually be involved in the project. The design team faced great challenges: Instruments had to be fitted into a severely restricted space, and, while the instrumentation had to be sufficiently precise to do the job, it also had to be tough enough to withstand the rigors of a space shuttle launch. Meanwhile, the team had to keep the project moving forward despite budget cuts, changes in NASA administrators, and rivalry among engineers, scientists, and bureaucrats. In the end, the experiments were spectacularly successful; the instruments sent back data that confirmed the Big Bang theory. Mather concludes by considering the larger cosmological questions yet to be answered, and reflecting on the place of human beings in the cosmos.

I left the apartment Mary and I were renting on rue Lepic and strolled in the sunshine up to rue des Abbesses. The old sidewalks were freshly washed, the air was still cool. My regular way was to get a morning paper, a brioche, and black coffee and then sit in the little park by the M�tro station and read. Sometimes I would walk up Yvonne-le-Tac to the terraced park below Sacr�-Coeur instead, but that morning I had that fistful of mail.<br><br>We took the apartment partly because it was right around the corner from the cemetery in Montmartre. Mary was writing an essay about the cemeteries of France for Harper's, a history of how they had been disrupted and desecrated by revolution, by the expansion of cities, and of course by the Church. The Cimeti�re de Montmartre was palpable, a reassurance to her. Many of its graves had been destroyed in 1789, the bodies treated like so much trash by those who hated royalty and aristocracy, and by the hoodlums who always attach themselves to social change. But Degas is buried there, the composer Berlioz, Nijinsky, and her favorite, Adolphe Sax, the inventor of the saxophone.<br><br>It was not these ghosts, though, nor the untroubled all�es colonnaded by plane trees, that calmed her. It was that the stillness sheltered an aggregation of mute evidence, apparent throughout the city in its small-scale neighborhoods, that our history is finally human. Regimes and ideologies-Tamerlane's Mongol empire, Caligula's Rome, Stalin's Soviet Union-whatever their horrors, whatever afflictions they deliver, pass away. What endures is simple devotion to the question of having been alive. The cemetery comforted her because it was not about death but about transcendent joie de vivre.<br><br>One day she returned to the apartment and read me an inscription she'd copied from a gravestone. Ma gracieuse �pouse . . . A husband had expressed his love and regard for his wife of fifty-one years in a few bare, unself-conscious sentences. Mary sat with the piece of paper in her hand by the open window, watching patrons in the bistro across the street talking and hailing friends passing on the sidewalk, and turned a shoulder so I could not see her crying.<br><br>Her tears, I thought, were over a kind of loss we had talked about in recent weeks, the way the fabric of love scorches, no matter how vigilant we are. The intricate nature of the emotions men and women exchange made the two of us sense our own endangerment when we disagreed; but we had also been speaking of the ephemeral love one can feel toward a complete stranger, for the way they step off a sidewalk or a father hands his daughter her gloves at the door. Bound together in these many ways we are still swept suddenly out of each other's lives, by tides we don't recognize and tides we do. The sensation of loss, the weight of grief, the feeling of being naked to a menace are hard to separate. The fear of an outside force at work makes us reticent in love, and suspicious. We identify enemies.<br><br>The instruments of discord show up daily in our lives, of course, demanding our attention. The unscrupulous peer, the woman on the make, the purblind enforcer, the self-anointed official and his cronies, people with a craving for confrontation. We are foolish to give any of them what they ask for, and we betray ourselves and anyone toward whom we have ever felt tender by not sending such people immediately on their way.<br><br>The first two pieces of mail I opened that morning were letters from museums, one in Rouen, the other in Orl�ans. At the time, I was trying to assemble work by European artists which had been shaped by their experience with le Maquis, the French underground, for a show to open at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis and then to travel around the United States. The communications were about insuring the works the museums were lending. I read each one with relief as, sentence by sentence, they eliminated the risks on my part. I should have known-the consideration.<br><br>The rest of the mail was personal-friends and family, some items of business for Mary. The one letter I put off reading sat all the while on the green slats of the bench while I finished perusing the paper. The envelope had the look of something you might be sent by the Internal Revenue Service, carrying news of an irregularity in your filings, a notice of additional tax due, perhaps a penalty. But the letter was from another federal authority, a branch of our government but a few years old though already monolithic. Its special charge was to make the nation safe from attack by a great array of vaguely defined "terrorists," domestic and foreign. This work it pursued with religious fervor and special exemptions from the Department of Justice.<br><br>I read the letter twice, concealed it in the half fold of Le Monde, and walked back to the apartment. Mary was in her robe, making breakfast. I handed her the letter and took her place at the stove.<br><br>She read it in the chair by the window.<br><br>"I will never get used to this hyperbolic crap," she said, folding the letter back up. "Every fascist step they take, you expect people to laugh in their faces, just take their toys away, you know-the guns and the new laws. Do they just not register the suspicion, the resentment in half the streets in the world?"<br><br>She turned abruptly to look out the window, as if responding to someone down there on the sidewalk. Incomprehension, exhaustion, fear passed behind her eyes. She let the letter drop to the floor as if it were an advertising circular.<br><br>"I can't believe we have to take people like this seriously, Owen."<br><br>I put breakfast on the table, refreshed her coffee, and came back with my laptop. I began e-mailing a loose network of people I'd been in regular touch with since the change of administration took place in our country. We communicated through a series of codes and used electronic back doors which delayed exchanges, but by mid-morning I'd confirmed what I had suspected. The letter had gone to everyone.<br><br>It came from Inland Security, the group of people we had come to call the Idiots of Light, for the way they are dazzled by their god. Their ranks include people who celebrate the insults of advertising and the deceptions of public relations campaigns as paths to redemption. The letter also originated with the Division of Economic Equality, those in the Department of Commerce we call the Lottery Enforcers, who argue for the calming and salutary effect of regular habits of purchase. And it bore the gold, eagle-talon insignia of the Delta Confederacy, the contingent of citizen groups that reports to the education staff of the Office of Inland Security.<br><br>The letter's authors informed us of the nation's persisting need for democratic reform. Each of us was told of widespread irritation with our work, and the government's desire to speak with us.<br><br>The authority behind the letter-two crisply printed cream-colored sheets of laid paper with signatures in red ballpoint-made my breath shudder. I sat watching for incoming e-mail. We hadn't anticipated this, not exactly this frontal an approach.<br><br>After university I and my friends had scattered abroad-to Brussels, Caracas, Sapporo, Melbourne, Jakarta, any promising corner. Two or three went deep upriver on the Orinoco or out onto the plateaus of Tibet and Ethiopia. We had come to regard the work of writers and artists in our country as too compliant, as failing to expose or indict the escalating nerve of corporate institutions, the increasing connivance of government with business, or the cowardice of those reporting the news. In the 1970s and '80s, we thought of our artists and writers as people gardening their reputations, while the families of our neighborhoods disintegrated into depression and anger, the schools flew apart, and species winked out. It was the triumph of adolescence, in a nation that wanted no part of its elders' remonstrance or any conversion to their doubt.<br><br>The years passed. We had no plan. We had no hope. We had no religion. We had faith. It was our belief that within the histories of other, older cultures we would find cause not to be incapacitated by the ludicracy of our own. It was our intuition that even in those cultures into which our own had injected its peculiar folklore-that success is financial achievement, that the future is better, that life is an entertainment-we would encounter enduring stories to trade in. We thought we might be able to discern a path in stories and performances rooted in disparaged pasts that would spring our culture out of its adolescence.<br><br>This remains to be seen. We stay in close touch (a modern convenience), scattered though we are. And now others, of course, keep close watch on us, on what we write and say, on whom we see. We are routinely denounced by various puppet guards at home, working diligently for a prison system we don't believe in. As the days have mounted, though, we've tasted more of the metal in that system's bars.<br><br>We feel cold.<br><br>Our goal is simple: we want our country to flourish. Our dilemma is simple: we cannot tell our people a story that sticks. It is not that no one believes what we say, that no one knows, that none of our countrymen cares. It is not that their outspoken objections have been silenced by the rise at home of local cadres of enforcement and shadow operatives. It is not that they do not understand. It is that they cannot act. And the response to tyranny of every sort, if it is to work, must always be this: dismantle it. Take it apart. Scatter its defenders and its proponents, like a flock of starlings fed to a hurricane.<br><br>Our strategy is this: we believe if we can say what many already know in such a way as to incite courage, if the image or the word or the act breaches the indifference by which people survive, day to day, enough will protest that by their physical voices alone they will stir the hurricane.<br><br>We're not optimistic. We chip away like coolies at the omnipotent and righteous fa�ade, but appear to ourselves as well as others to be ineffective dissenters. We've found nothing to use against tyranny that has not been written down or danced out or sung up ten thousand times. It is the somnolence, the great deafness, that reveals our problems. It is illiteracy. It is an appetite for distraction, which has become a cornerstone of life in our nation. In distraction one encounters the deaf. In utter distraction one discovers the refuge of illiteracy.<br><br>And here is nearly the bitterest of blunt issues for us: What can love offer that cannot be rejected? What gesture cannot be maligned as witless by those who strive for every form of isolation? When we were young, each of us believed that to love was to die. Then we believed that to love was essential. Now we believe that without love our homeland-perhaps all countries-will perish. Over the years, as we have learned what it might mean to love, we have generally agreed that we've better understood the risks. In our nation, it is acceptable to resent love as an interference with personal liberty, as a ruse the emotions employ before the battlements of reason. It is the abused in our country who now most weirdly profess love. For the ordinary person, love is increasingly elusive, imagined as a strategy.<br><br>We reject the assertion, promoted today by success-mongering bull terriers in business, in government, in religion, that humans are goal-seeking animals. We believe they are creatures in search of proportion in life, a pattern of grace. It is balance and beauty we believe people want, not triumph. The stories the earth's peoples adhere to with greatest faith-the dances that topple fearful walls; the ethereal performances of light, color, and music; the enduring musics themselves-are all well patterned. And these templates for the maintenance of vision, repeated continuously in wildly different idioms, from the eras of Lascaux and Shanidar to the days of the Prado and Butoh, these patterns from the artesian wells of artistic impulse, do not require updating. They require only repetition. Repetition, because just as murder and infidelity are within us, so, too, is forgetfulness. We forget what we want to mean. To achieve progress, we've all but cut our heads off.<br><br>We found the Inland Security letter ridiculous, but also alarming. It declared that, as none of us had renounced his or her citizenship, we would be interrogated as nationals "with the full cooperation of the stewards of democracy in your host countries." We might then be indicted; or dismissed and ignored; or possibly turned over to local authorities, "some of whom," we were advised, "might have no regard for due process, the writ of habeas corpus, or other advancements in law which are found in civilized countries." The disposition of our cases, it was made clear, would not be at our discretion.<br><br>Our stratagems, the letter continued, were those typical of "terrorist cells." They called for scrutiny; and we had to desist. We were reminded, then, not any longer to circulate those texts, images, music, and films already listed as anti-democratic in monthly bulletins from the Select Committee on the Arts, an innovation of the Offices of the President. Or any artistic or literary works created by cultures "inimical to our nation's policies." To achieve wealth, the letter informed us, is the desire of all peoples everywhere; and while our nation was working to establish wealth for all peoples everywhere, resistance like ours, a quibbling over methods, actually created poverty.<br><br>The letter explained, in phrases that bore the brushstrokes of zealots and lawyers, that we were to be sought out, quizzed, and possibly punished or isolated from society, because we "were terrorizing the imaginations of our fellow citizens" with our books, paintings, and performances. Sojourning, some of us, with "unadvanced" cultures, attending to their myths and stories, along with making inquiries into primitive or revolutionary art, had poisoned our capacity to understand civilization's triumphs. We were attempting to resurrect the past and have it stand equal with the present. We profoundly misunderstood, our accusers argued, the promise of the future. We were offering only darkness where for some centuries the fires of freedom had been blazing, the beacons of prosperity increasing in their intensity.<br><br>The letter implied that there was still hope for us, however. The interrogations, the extraditions, trials, and incarcerations-these need not follow a predictable course. Apology, if of the most profound sort, was a possibility. Reeducation was an option. Missionary work, yet another possibility. In a democracy, the acknowledgment of one's errors, coupled with a suitable penance, could leave an individual with a very bright future. Some, inevitably, would have to face harsh punishment for fooling with the country's destiny.</p><h2>Simply Shetland Lace: 6 Knitted Stitches, 20 Beautiful Projects</h2><p><b>Learn how to master three classic Shetland lace motifs&#x2014;just six simple stitches&#x2014;and build your skills with 20 beautiful and varied projects, too! </b><br> &nbsp;<br> Explore traditional Shetland lace knitting with expert teacher Brooke Nico!

If women were regarded as human, would they be sold into sexual slavery worldwide; veiled, silenced, and imprisoned in homes; bred, and worked as menials for little or no pay; stoned for sex outside marriage or burned within it; mutilated genitally, impoverished economically, and mired in illiteracy--all as a matter of course and without effective recourse?</p><p>The cutting edge is where law and culture hurts, which is where MacKinnon operates in these essays on the transnational status and treatment of women. Taking her gendered critique of the state to the international plane, ranging widely intellectually and concretely, she exposes the consequences and significance of the systematic maltreatment of women and its systemic condonation. And she points toward fresh ways--social, legal, and political--of targeting its toxic orthodoxies. </p><p>MacKinnon takes us inside the workings of nation-states, where the oppression of women defines community life and distributes power in society and government. She takes us to Bosnia-Herzogovina for a harrowing look at how the wholesale rape and murder of women and girls there was an act of genocide, not a side effect of war. She takes us into the heart of the international law of conflict to ask--and reveal--why the international community can rally against terrorists' violence, but not against violence against women. A critique of the transnational status quo that also envisions the transforming possibilities of human rights, this bracing book makes us look as never before at an ongoing war too long undeclared.</p></p><p>Catharine A.

This book, the first Western survey of this important artist, accompanies the Smithsonian's Arthur M. Sackler Gallery exhibition of the same name.<br><br>Tawaraya S&#x14d;tatsu was a commoner who introduced traditional Japanese themes and subjects, formerly the sole purview of the aristocracy, to broader audiences. He painted these nationalistic images using a bold, expressive new design style. This characteristic style was further developed and enhanced when he founded the historic Rinpa school with calligrapher Hon'ami K&#x14d;etsu; Rinpa works are marked by dramatic, stylized renderings of traditional Japanese themes. Essays by leading scholars from the United States and Japan focus on S&#x14d;tatsu's well-known works; his collaboration with K&#x14d;etsu; his varied roles as shopkeeper, compiler, and court painter; and his influence over other artists, including Ogata K&#x14d;rin, Ogata Kenzan, Sakai H&#x14d;itsu, and Suzuki Kiitsu. The book also examines Freer Gallery of Art founder Charles Lang Freer's role in introducing S&#x14d;tatsu and K&#x14d;etsu to the Western world. <i>S&#x14d;tatsu</i> is a must-have book for museumgoers, Japanophiles, art lovers, and scholars.</p><p>JAMES T.

(through January 31, 2016).&nbsp; The editors, Lippit and Ulak, have chosen an impressive group of specialists for the included essays (Furuta Ryo, Nakamachi Keiko, Noguchi Takeshi, Okudaira Shunroku, and Ota Aya), which focus on Sotatsu&#x2019;s career: his beginnings as a painter of fans, his relationship with the calligrapher Koetsu (which produced breathtakingly beautiful scrolls), the origins of the artist&#x2019;s seal grass and flower paintings, and the iconography of the dynamic, large-scale screens that characterize his major work for illustrious Edo patrons.&nbsp; A final chapter focuses on the artist&#x2019;s influence in the 20th century.&nbsp; The magnificent screen Waves at Matsushima, painted early in 1600 and acquired in 1906 by Charles Lang Freer, is one of the highlights of the exhibition.&nbsp; The catalogue, with four double fold-out pages of the large-scale screens, rich with color and meticulously documented, is the state-of-the-art research on Sotatsu.&nbsp; With an exhaustive bibliography and an invaluable glossary, this book is essential for scholars, students, and connoisseurs of Japanese art.</p><h2>Chosen: Super Special (Canterwood Crest)</h2><p>Lauren Towers has always had one dream: to be a professional equestrian, competing with the best of the best.

He always ended the ride with a funny, &#x201c;hip&#x201d; saying. This May morning hadn&#x2019;t been any different.<br> <br>&#x201c;G2G, Laur,&#x201d; Dad said. I could see him focus on the acronyms. &#x201c;Holler back if you need a ride.&#x201d;<br> <br>Grinning, I got out of the car. &#x201c;Don&#x2019;t talk to anyone. Please.&#x201d;<br> <br>Dad headed for work and I went into the school&#x2019;s main building.<br> <br>I walked down the hallway of Yates Preparatory School to my locker. I dropped my heavy backpack on the floor and spun the combination into my lock until it clicked open. Yates was my fave school so far of all the schools I&#x2019;d attended. I&#x2019;d moved around a lot to compete on the show circuit and Yates was my third school.<br> <br>Doing well academically had always been important to me, and I&#x2019;d worked hard to keep up my grades while riding. I&#x2019;d even taken extra courses online last summer. It had paid off when I&#x2019;d been accepted to Yates.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, LT.&#x201d;<br> <br>I peered around the metal door and saw Taylor grinning at me.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hi,&#x201d; I said, hugging him. He was a few inches taller than me and his cropped blond hair had been bleached by the sun from spending so many hours practicing in the pool. His tanned skin contrasted with my own pale coloring. I took in the sprinkle of freckles across his nose that I loved.<br> <br>&#x201c;Missed you this weekend,&#x201d; I said.<br> <br>&#x201c;Me too.&#x201d; Taylor held my hand, leaning up against the lockers. &#x201c;I hate it when things get so crazy. But Dad insisted that I shadow him at his office, even though it was a weekend.&#x201d;<br> <br>I rolled my eyes. Taylor and I had been together for five months, and his dad, an investment banker, seemed to want Taylor to decide to follow in the family footsteps and take over the business. Like, yesterday.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry he&#x2019;s pressuring you so much,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re <i>twelve</i>. Aren&#x2019;t we supposed to be able to change whatever we want to be every day if we want?&#x201d;<br> <br>Taylor squeezed my hand, letting it go so he could shove his hands into his pockets. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m used to it.&#x201d; He smiled. &#x201c;Anyway, Mondays are gross enough. Let&#x2019;s talk about something waaay better.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Like?&#x201d; The enthusiasm in his hazel eyes was infectious.<br> <br>&#x201c;Want to go out on Saturday night? We can do something fun&#x2014;whatever you want.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Whatever <i>I</i> want? I like the sound of that.&#x201d; We smiled at each other. &#x201c;I&#x2019;d love to.&#x201d;<br> <br>The warning bell rang, startling us both. I hadn&#x2019;t even gathered my books for class. Yates had a zero-tolerance policy for lateness and I didn&#x2019;t want to spend my afternoon in detention.<br> <br>&#x201c;Perfect,&#x201d; Taylor said. &#x201c;Text you later.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bye.&#x201d;<br> <br>My excitement about going out with Taylor on Friday made me grab my math book instead of the one I needed for history class. I realized it just before I closed my locker. I switched out the books then hurried to the class I shared with Brielle and Ana.<br> <br>Yates was so small I got to share a lot of classes with my two best friends. Everyone knew everyone here. At first, I&#x2019;d been worried about fitting in. The size of the school made it seem cliquey. But Brielle and Ana had become instant besties.<br> <br>I snagged a seat in the center of the classroom.<br> <br>&#x201c;Hey, Lauren,&#x201d; Amber said, walking inside with her group of friends.<br> <br>I said hi to her and a few other people as they sat down, furiously opening their textbooks and notebooks. We all wanted to look as if we&#x2019;d been in class way early to win points with Mr. Newton&#x2014;one of the toughest teachers at Yates.<br> <br>&#x201c;Laur, omigodwehavetotalkrightnow!&#x201d;<br> <br>I laughed, looking up at Brielle as she plopped down next to me. Ana sat on my other side, a smile turning up her lips. They were both fun friends to hang out with at school <i>and</i> at the stable.<br> <br>&#x201c;What&#x2019;s up?&#x201d; I asked.<br> <br>Brielle&#x2019;s cool black hair was pulled into a high, shiny ponytail. The gloss treatment we&#x2019;d all gotten at the salon a couple of weeks ago made her hair look extra gorge. Her fair, freckle-free, never-left-the-house-without-SPF-fifty complexion showed just enough makeup to not get her in trouble with her parents. She had a light coat of mascara, blush, and pale pink-tinted gloss. Brielle was the epitome of a girly-girl.<br> <br>She looked seasonably adorable today in a Marc Jacobs light pink dress with capped sleeves and a cream-colored cardigan. She had strappy, white wedges to match that I noted (since we were the same shoe size) I&#x2019;d probably be asking to borrow next week.<br> <br>&#x201c;I heard from Kendra, who heard from Madison, who heard from Portia, that Will is going to ask me to the end-of-the-year dance!&#x201d; Brielle&#x2019;s tone had reached a near shriek.<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s awesome!&#x201d; I said, beaming for her.<br> <br>Ana leaned over toward my desk. &#x201c;Now we just have to get Will to ask Brielle already, so she can start dress shopping. Even though the dance isn&#x2019;t for a couple of weeks, she&#x2019;s already freaking out about her dress <i>and</i> shoes <i>and</i> accessories.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ll get all of that,&#x201d; I said, glancing between both of my friends. &#x201c;Taylor&#x2019;s taking me and I haven&#x2019;t picked out anything yet either.&#x201d;<br> <br>I grinned at Ana in a teasing way. &#x201c;And are we getting <i>you</i> into a dress?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Ana groaned. &#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t it enough that I&#x2019;m going? I&#x2019;m happy you both have dates, and I&#x2019;m going to be there from the hair blow-out to the fastening of your strappy shoes, but I&#x2019;m going solo. You know I&#x2019;m only focused on two things&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>Brielle and I finished the sentence along with her. &#x201c;Writing and illustrating.&#x201d;<br> <br>Ana pulled out her notebook that she&#x2019;d covered in gorgeous pen sketches of people, animals, buildings, and anything else that had caught her attention.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m an <i>artiste</i>,&#x201d; Ana said, her tone playful. &#x201c;I refuse to be distracted by boys. Or anything else.&#x201d;<br> <br>Brielle and I didn&#x2019;t argue with her. Ana was one of the most talented artists at our entire school. She dressed the part, too. Today, she was <i>tr�s</i> (French for &#x201c;very&#x201d;) chic in an ivory beret that was slightly back behind her hairline, black leggings, and ballet flats. She&#x2019;d curled her light brown hair into waves and the highlights made her skin tone glow.<br> <br>She pushed the makeup rule a little more than Brielle. She&#x2019;d been doing it for months and had never gotten in trouble. This morning she had a thin line of black liquid eyeliner with the slightest cat-eye curve that looked amazing and brought out her wide, brown eyes.<br> <br>&#x201c;Speaking of which, is your creative writing group today?&#x201d; I asked Ana.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yeah, I&#x2019;m meeting up with art class friends to critique one another&#x2019;s sketches. It&#x2019;s one of our last meetings before school&#x2019;s out for summer. You guys?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing nothing for finals,&#x201d; Brielle said. &#x201c;Boring.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve got glee club,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;Then homework for me.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Glee will be distracting,&#x201d; Ana said. &#x201c;Hopefully it&#x2019;ll keep you from thinking about Canterwood.&#x201d;<br> <br>Canterwood Crest Academy&#x2014;those three words made my skin prickle. Canterwood was one of the best, most prestigious boarding schools in the country with an extremely well-known riding program. From what I&#x2019;d heard, the extracurriculars there&#x2014;in particular the equestrian team&#x2014;were as tough as the academics.<br> <br>Ever since I&#x2019;d heard about it, I&#x2019;d been obsessed with Canterwood. I loved everything about the school&#x2014;from its green and gold school colors to the photos on the Web site to the descriptions of the student dorms.<br> <br>I&#x2019;d applied months ago and once I started thinking about it, I couldn&#x2019;t stop. I was already close to camping out in front of my mailbox.<br> <br>&#x201c;Definitely,&#x201d; I said, smiling. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m just ready to get through classes and go to glee.&#x201d;<br> <br>Glee club was one of the only things that made me look forward to Mondays. I wasn&#x2019;t even close to being the best singer in the club, but I loved singing and performing. Last week our club had performed a new song from Sierra, a hot new hip-hop artist, and it had been so much fun. Our club just formed this year and we were already prepping to start competing next year.<br> <br><i>Next year</i>.<br> <br>Next year I&#x2019;d likely be at Yates competing in glee. Or maybe, just maybe, I&#x2019;d be competing somewhere different altogether. Somewhere like Canterwood Crest Academy.</p><h2>Wok Wisely: Chinese Vegetarian Cooking - A monastery&#39;s approach to food and spiritual well-being</h2><p>Not just a cookbook, but a way of life for your body, mind and spirit, Wok Wisely, Chinese Vegetarian Cooking, presents not only a collection of nourishing, flavorful recipes, but information on how to keep the body in balance.

A lifelong Marine widely considered to be one of America's greatest generals, Mattis was committed to keeping America safe. Yet he served a President whose actions were frequently unpredictable and impulsive with far-reaching consequences. <br><br>Often described as the administration's "adult in the room," Mattis has said very little about his difficult role, and since his resignation has kept his views of the President and his policies private. Now, Mattis's former chief speechwriter and communications director, Guy M. Snodgrass, brings readers behind that curtain.

A former naval aviator and F/A-18 pilot, he served as a commanding officer of a fighter squadron based in Japan, a TOPGUN instructor, and a combat pilot over the skies of Iraq as part of his twenty-year navy career.

He would not be coming back. <br><br>He&#x2019;d had enough. He was done. <br><br> His resignation&#x2014;and its blunt manner&#x2014;launched shock waves through a town that by now seemed impervious to the seismic blasts regularly exploding throughout the Trump admin�istration. <br><br> Officially, Mattis had gone to the Oval Office to reverse the president&#x2019;s tweet-born announcement of a precipitous troop pull-out from Syria. He failed, and when that happened, he in�formed Trump he was leaving. <br><br> But that wasn&#x2019;t the whole truth. There&#x2019;s precious little whole truth in Washington. Mattis&#x2019;s outrage over Syria, while real, was only a pretext to announce a decision he had made months be�fore to cut his losses and move on. <br><br> And why not? To survive in Washington, you need alliances. One by one, what administration allies Mattis once had vanished into the night: Secretary of State Rex Tillerson, National Secu�rity Adviser H. R. McMaster, and now Trump&#x2019;s chief of staff, John Kelly, had one foot out the door. <br><br> Trump later tweeted that Mattis was &#x201c;retiring.&#x201d; He wasn&#x2019;t. <br><br> Arriving at the Pentagon, Mattis immediately distributed copies of his previously composed resignation letter to defense reporters. The letter minced few words. Its key section high�lighted the disparity between a president and his secretary of defense, saying: <br><br> &#x201c;My views on treating allies with respect and also being clear-eyed about both malign actors and strategic competitors are strongly held and informed by over four decades of immersion in these issues. We must do everything possible to advance an inter�national order that is most conducive to our security, prosperity and values, and we are strengthened in this effort by the solidar�ity of our alliances. <br><br> &#x201c;Because you have the right to have a Secretary of Defense whose views are better aligned with yours on these and other subjects, I believe it is right for me to step down from my position.&#x201d; <br><br>James Mattis, the quintessential Marine, had learned some valuable and painful lessons while serving the Trump administra�tion. Prime among them was how to spell a new word: <i>defeat. <br></i><br> And, to be honest about it, so had I.</p><h2>We Give a Squid a Wedgie (An Accidental Adventure)</h2><p>If Oliver and Celia Navel had any hopes this year would be less life-threatening than the last, their hopes are quickly shattered...along with their television set.

As our capacities for production and our aptitude for consumption have increased, so have their byproducts&#x2015;chemical contamination from fertilizers and pesticides, diesel emissions, oil spills, a vast &#x201c;plastic continent&#x201d; found floating in the ocean. <i>The Contamination of the Earth</i> offers a social and political history of industrial pollution, mapping its trajectories over three centuries, from the toxic wastes of early tanneries to the fossil fuel energy regime of the twentieth century.</p><p>The authors describe how, from 1750 onward, in contrast to the early modern period, polluted water and air came to be seen as inevitable side effects of industrialization, which was universally regarded as beneficial. By the nineteenth century, pollutants became constituent elements of modernity. The authors trace the evolution of these various pollutions, and describe the ways in which they were simultaneously denounced and permitted. The twentieth century saw new and massive scales of pollution: chemicals that resisted biodegradation, including napalm and other defoliants used as weapons of war; the ascendancy of oil; and a lifestyle defined by consumption. In the 1970s, pollution became a political issue, but efforts&#x2015;local, national, and global&#x2015;to regulate it often fell short. Viewing the history of pollution though a political lens, the authors also offer lessons for the future of the industrial world.<br></p></p><p>Fran�ois Jarrige is Senior Lecturer in Contemporary History at the University of Burgundy's Georges Chevrier Centre.<br><br>Thomas Le Roux is a tenured Researcher at the French National Centre for Scientific Research (CNRS), based at the Centre for Historical Research in the School for Advanced Studies in the Social Sciences (CRH-EHESS) in Paris.<br><br>Michael Egan is Associate Professor of History at McMaster University and Director of the Sustainable Future History Project.</p><h2>Diaries of the Chinese Martyrs</h2><p><p>With tens of millions killed and thousands of Catholics incarcerated because of rigged trials, China under Mao's dictatorship was the Asian version of the Nazi concentration camps and the Soviet Gulag.

Newly-elected president Stephen Blades hoped to tackle the most critical issues facing the nation: war, the economy, and a failing health care system. But in a letter penned by the outgoing president, Blades learns the truth that redefines "critical": seven years ago, NASA discovered alien presence in the asteroid belt, and kept it a secret from the world. A stealth mission crewed by nine astronauts was sent to make contact, and they're getting close&#x2014;assuming they survive the long journey to reach their destination.

In Asia, however, strategic thinking is a formal discipline studied by people from all walks of life. Amazing as it may seem, contemporary Asians base their outlook and behavior on the teachings of the ancients. In China, even children are familiar with the "36 Strategies," formulated by Sun Tzu, a famous military strategist, in the fourth century B.C. <br> Throughout Asia today, business people as well as political figures study Sun Tzu's <i>Art of War</i> and apply its strategies to all their activities, while Americans read <i>The One-Minute Manager</i> and <i>All I Really Need to Know I Learned In Kindergarten.</i> No wonder, Ms. Chu comments, that when it comes to business and political negotiations, the Chinese refer to Americans with a word that means "innocent children." <br> Ms. Chu brilliantly analyses how Chinese thought and culture have affected Japan, Korea, and Taiwan, and how Japanese conquest and culture have had their effect on the rest of Asia. <br> With United States trade and political alliances shifting increasingly to the Pacific rim, it becomes ever more urgent to understand the Asian mind. Ms. Chu, born in China and educated in Taiwan, spells out the makeup of the Asian psyche as no Westerner could.</p><p><b>Chin-Ning Chu</b> is president of Asian Marketing Consultants, Inc. She counsels Western companies doing or wishing to do business in Asia. Born in Teinjin, near Beijing, she was raised in Taiwan after the fall of mainland China to the Communists. She has studied the teachings of sages in India, China, and Europe and believes her study of philosophy and psychology provides her with a powerful tool with which to examine the complexities of philosophical, sociological, and historical influences on the shaping of the modern Asian mind. Ms. Chu lives in Beaverton, Oregon.<b>Chapter 1</b><br><br><b>Preparing for the Game</b><br><br>The telephone in my Beijing hotel room rang. It was the Washington Post's Beijing Bureau Chief, Daniel Southerland, asking if I could meet the following day with him and a Canadian businessman, whom we will call David Buyer. He told me Mr. Buyer had taken a beating on his first business foray into China. Knowing that I was in the city, Dan thought Mr. Buyer might want to talk to me about what had gone wrong. We met in the lounge of the hotel and found a quiet corner where we could speak freely.<br><br>David Buyer came from a Canadian family with a long-established reputation in the fur business. Four months earlier, Buyer had flown into China on a custom-fitted Boeing 747 with 3,200 live foxes. In exchange for the foxes and his technical assistance in setting up scientific breeding and feeding programs, he had expected to return to Canada with about a million dollars' profit. But things had not worked out that way.<br><br>Mr. Buyer was leaving on the next day's early flight bound for home. He would leave without his million dollars and without his foxes. Once at home he would close the books on a loss of about a half million dollars and would attempt to save his fox farm from foreclosure.<br><br>David Buyer's unfortunate adventure started in the summer of 1988. Months passed as he waited impatiently for the arrival of a Chinese delegation that was to inspect the foxes. Buyer thought that perhaps they didn't want to make such a long trip and were putting it off. The real problem, however, was the complicated passport and entry visa procedures they were dealing with.<br><br>Buyer was selling breeding stock to the Chinese, and he did not want to miss the fox breeding season. As the season neared, he grew more and more anxious. He was confident that his stock would pass the most rigorous inspection, so he notified the Chinese that he would fly the foxes to China. They could conclude the deal on his arrival. The Chinese voiced no objection to the idea. At the moment the jet lifted off with its noisy cargo, Mr. Buyer's deal was already dead, but he would not find that out for several months.<br><br>Shortly after Buyer arrived in China, the price of fox dropped on the world fur market. Since Buyer had 3,200 unsold and hungry foxes 10,000 miles from home, the Chinese used the market fluctuation as a pretext to renegotiate the contract. To put even more pressure on him, the Chinese charged with the care of the foxes deliberately starved them and crowded them into very small cages. Soon disease and mistreatment had killed 150 of Buyer's foxes.<br><br>When Buyer found out that the Chinese had started buying quantities of foxes from a breeder in Finland, he was ready to cut his losses. He sought out intermediaries who could break the impasse and put together a deal for him before all his foxes were dead. The intermediaries, of course, insisted on substantial puffs. After extensive negotiation, the intermediaries managed to convince the original buyers to take 900 of the 3,200 foxes at the original price of $380 each, but these buyers would offer only $30 apiece for the remaining animals.<br><br>Eventually, the intermediaries were able to sell the remaining foxes by unofficial means at greatly reduced prices. But, in addition to cutting his prices drastically, to conclude the sale Buyer had to agree to sponsor a dozen children of various Chinese bureaucrats to be educated in Canada. Four years of college tuition and living expenses for each child was to come out of his pocket. But Buyer had learned the ways of the Chinese by now. He told them anything they wanted to hear so that he could unload his foxes and get out of there.<br><br>The evening we met, Mr. Buyer was carrying $200,000 in American currency sewn into the lining of his coat. The unofficial nature of the transactions his intermediaries had arranged precluded the usual avenues of transferring money out of China. In addition to the devastating financial loss he had suffered, he was also running a very grave risk of spending the rest of his life in a Chinese prison if airport security detected the cash.<br><br>Buyer had made a serious mistake in shipping the foxes without first receiving payment. But this was not his first or most serious mistake. It was not until my return to China in August 1989 that I found out what the real problem had been.<br><br>I decided to contact Mr. Zhang, the Chinese official who had originally arranged the deal with David Buyer. It took only a few moments' conversation with Mr. Zhang to find out what had happened. He was eager to express his anger with Mr. Buyer. Buyer's decision to fly the foxes to China instead of waiting for Zhang and his associates to come to him had robbed them of a trip to Canada to which they had looked forward for months. Foreign travel is the most prestigious and sought-after perk available to a Chinese official. They could not forgive Buyer for robbing them of their once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to visit the West. The disappointment completely dampened their enthusiasm for the entire project.<br><br>Mr. Buyer's story is an extreme example, but the lack of understanding that it illustrates is all too common. In my professional life as a representative for Western companies doing business in Asia, I am constantly frustrated by the inability of Eastern and Western minds to meet.<br><br>The great difference between Western and Asian languages is one obvious barrier to understanding. But language is not only how we express our thoughts, it is also how we create our thoughts. The underlying cause of misunderstanding is not language itself but how we think: Asians and Westerners think as differently as they speak.<br><br>I once heard Donald Frisbee, CEO and Chairman of PacifiCorp, say, "If I could just understand how the Asian thinks, I would know how to deal with him." Mr. Frisbee is much more perceptive than most Western businessmen in recognizing the difficulty. Many just assume that they understand, and simply don't want to be told otherwise. I once spent a long afternoon listening to a man who had thirty-five years of successful marketing experience in the United States. "Marketing is marketing," he told me. "I know my business. What could be different about marketing in Asia?"<br><br>Books have been written about doing business in Asia. Many are well researched and accurate in their description of how Asians conduct their business affairs, but none I have read has shed much light on why Asians conduct business as they do. Learning about an Asian businessman's actions without understanding his motivation will not greatly help a Westerner to conduct business successfully with him. It is essential to understand the underlying causes of the Asian person's actions. This book is about those underlying causes.<br><br>Strategic thinking is deeply ingrained in the Asian mind. Specific strategies to deal with all kinds of life situations have been developed, refined, and studied for thousands of years. If the Westerner does not make an attempt to understand something of the Asian mind, he will find it almost impossible to detect the web of complicated strategies that is woven about him by his Asian counterparts, and he will fall victim to them.<br><br>Like David Buyer, too often Westerners have paid dearly for their lack of understanding in dealing with Asians. Mr. Buyer was not a fool. He made an assumption about the Chinese delegation's reasons for delaying their visit to Canada. Within the frame of reference of a Western businessman, it was a good assumption, Mr. Buyer's mistake was that he did not question his belief that what was true for him was also true for the Chinese.<br><br>I am a Chinese woman. My family lived for many generations near the Yalu River in Manchuria. As boys, my father and his friends would pay the boatman a few small coins to ferry them across the Yalu to fight mock battles with the Korean boys on the farther shore. At that time, as today, the Yalu was the political boundary between Korea and Manchuria, but over the centuries the border had moved back and forth across the land. The culture of the region was a mixture of Chinese and Korean.<br><br>The Japanese had been a presence in Manchuria dating back to the late nineteenth century. In 1931, they officially annexed Manchuria as a Japanese territory. As a colonial power, the Japanese behave very differently from Western colonial powers. They do not simply seek to exploit the wealth and resources of their colonies, they also attempt to replace the native language and culture with Japanese language and culture. They try to instill in the conquered peoples a sense of pride and identity as Japanese subjects.<br><br>My parents were educated according to a Japanese curriculum by Japanese teachers in a school where only Japanese was spoken. They learned to speak fluent Japanese and absorbed a great deal of Japanese culture. My mother often passed as a Japanese national in order to obtain better treatment for her family than was accorded to most Chinese under the occupation. In 1949, my family left the mainland for Taiwan, where I was raised.<br><br>Taiwan, like Manchuria, had been a Japanese colony for the half-century prior to Japan's defeat in World War II. Throughout my girlhood, the schools retained their Japanese influence. When the teachers would get angry they would curse us in Japanese. It was not until I was an adult and had traveled extensively in Asia and the West that I came to understand how very Japanese my family was -- and also how Korean.<br><br>The Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans share many common characteristics, but there are also marked differences between them. Westerners tend to see the similarities, but are unfamiliar with the differences. They tend to see them as Asians rather than Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans. It is the purpose of this book to give you an individual and personal sense of what it is to be a Chinese, a Japanese, and a Korean and to show how this affects dealings between Westerners and people of these nationalities. To do this, I must discuss the separate national characteristics.<br><br>It is always a little misleading to take traits that are individual in nature and apply them with broad strokes to a whole nation. If it is done at all, it must be done carefully, otherwise we descend into meaningless stereotyping. However, it is a useful way to discuss values and beliefs that are shared widely, if not universally, among the individuals who make up the nation. There is such a thing as a collective consciousness. There are such things as national characteristics. I am going to discuss them without intent to minimize the diversity that exists within each group and without intending to offend anyone.<br><br>The important thing about the generalizations I will make is not their literal truth, but that they are commonly accepted to be true by the very people who are being stereotyped. The Chinese especially have a penchant for analyzing the Chinese character in the form of a hypothetical "typical Chinese." The shortcomings of this character are often referred to as the "national disease," the virtues as the "national character."<br><br>I am not writing a scholarly study. I do not intend to cite statistics to back up every statement I make. I am dealing in common perceptions. When I state flatly that "Korean businessmen like to drink. They drink heavily and hold their liquor well," I am not going to refer to the latest study on per capita Korean alcohol consumption. Nor do I wish to be taken literally to mean that there are no abstemious or moderate Korean businessmen. What I mean is that if you stop a hundred people at random on the streets of Seoul, Beijing, and Tokyo and ask them, "Do Koreans drink?" eighty of them will laugh and say, "Like fish." In making statements like this, it is not my intent to attack the Korean character, but only to arm my Western readers with the common knowledge that any Asian would have: "If you are going to go glass-for-glass with your Korean host, you had better know what you're doing."<br><br>The Asian peoples will all agree that there are discernible national characteristics that define the Chinese, the Koreans, and the Japanese. They will further agree on what those characteristics are. They differ on whether those accepted characteristics are virtues or vices, and their differences depend largely upon whether the characteristics are applied to them or to someone else.<br><br>To some racially sensitive Western readers, discussions of the characteristics of separate ethnic and national groups might seem to border on racism. The Asian concept of racism is very different from the Western concept. Concepts of racial superiority and inferiority have never been questioned as they have been in the West. There are strong feelings among the Chinese, Japanese, and Koreans on the subject of racial superiority, even though the peoples are very closely related from an evolutionary standpoint. In Asia the idea that one people is racially superior to another is almost universally acknowledged.<br><br>Asians do not have the same sensitivity to racial issues as do Americans. The issue is not as emotionally charged for them. Asians regard it as natural to feel that their race, their nation, their province, their city, and their family are better than yours. Westerners exhibit most of these same attitudes and refer to them in mildly pejorative terms such as "chauvinistic," "nationalistic," "provincial." But "racist" is a very ugly word in English, even though it often only expresses the common weakness of mankind to believe that "mine is better than yours."<br><br>The preoccupation with race is so acute in America that one cannot make reference to race at all for fear of giving offense. Henrietta Anne Klauser, author of Writing on Both Sides of the Brain (Harper &amp; Row, 1987), told me of an excited call she got from her editor prior to the book's publication. The editor insisted on a sentence being rewritten because it contained a racially offensive word. This is the sentence: "I have a great respect for paper and I daily bless the Chinaman who invented it." The sentence the editor found acceptable was this: "I have a great respect for paper and I daily bless its Chinese inventor." To this Chinese woman, the first version expressed the personal affection that Mrs. Klauser felt for the Chinese. The sterilized version had lost the sensitive touch. It is very hard for an Asian to understand what the problem was with the original.<br><br>Ruby Chow, a retired long-time King County (Washington State) councilwoman, told me the following story:<br><br>In the early 1950's, Seattle's Chinatown was renamed "The International District." The reasons for the change are not completely clear. In recent years, there has been a movement to restore the name Chinatown. The restoration has been opposed by some members of the City Council. Norm Rice, when he was serving as a city councilman prior to his election as mayor, opposed the restoration of the name on the grounds that it was an insulting stereotype. Peter Woo, president of the Chong Wa Benevolent Association and a leader of the Chinese community in Seattle, stated publicly that he disagreed with Rice that it was an insulting stereotype.<br><br>Asian-born Chinese are proud to be Chinese and, in general, would not have a problem with the name Chinatown. Chinese-Americans who have been brought up with American attitudes about race would be more likely to be offended. Councilman Rice, with all the good intentions in the world, seemed to be bringing his perspective as a black American to bear on a problem that did not have the same seriousness for the people who should have been most offended.<br><br>Asians do not feel guilty about thinking in racial terms, but they do understan...</p><h2>Slappy&#39;s Revenge (Goosebumps: Movie): Twisted Tricks from the World&#39;s Smartest Dummy</h2><p>THE GOOSEBUMPS MOVIE captures the chills, thrills, and giggles of Scholastic's original bestselling series.

This chaotic time witnessed a new type of right-wing thinking: traditionalist, yet oriented towards a new beginning . . . consciously nationalist (<em>v�lkisch</em>), yet civilizational in scope . . . born in the despair of defeat and humiliation, yet envisioning a triumphant new age. The Conservative Revolutionaries sought an "overthrow of an overthrow."</p><p>Armin Mohler, who knew many of these figures personally, traces the development of this German ideal from Friedrich Nietzsche, Richard Wagner, Oswald Spengler, Thomas Mann, Arthur Moeller van den Bruck, Ernst J�nger, Carl Schmitt, and beyond.

Crow pursues a perhaps unpopular notion of Christianity's continued presence in modern abstract art and in the process makes a case for art's own terrain of theology: one that eschews idolatry by means of abstraction. Tracking the original anti-idolatry controversy of the Jansenists, anchored in a humble still life by Chardin, <i>No Idols</i> sets the scene for the development of an art of reflection rather than representation, and divinity without doctrine.

Oversized, perverse, requiring an unusual amount of listener background knowledge? Yes to all. Yet the collective improvisations it captures, unprecedentedly coherent yet freewheeling and open-ended, are unique in rock 'n' roll.</p><p>This book considers the music and moment of Phish's ecstatically inventive 1995 live document, a mix of weirdo acid-psych, ambient moonscapes, vaudevillian Americana, and riotous arena-rock energy, all filtered through bandleader Trey Anastasio's screwball compositional sensibility and the band's idiosyncratic approach to spontaneous group creativity. It places Phish and their fandom in historical and cultural context, and picks apart the mechanics of their extended group jams. And it examines the mystery of how a quartet of nice boys from Burlington, VT could have been, all at once, one of America's biggest touring acts and one of its best-kept secrets.</p></p><p>An in-depth study of Phish's live album <i>A Live One</i> and its cultural significance<b>Walter Holland</b> is a freelance writer living in Cambridge, MA.</p><h2>Good Stock: Life on a Low Simmer</h2><p><i>Good Stock</i> is the story of Sanford "Sandy" D'Amato's journey from young Italian kid who loved to cook to unknown culinary student with a passion for classical French cuisine to one of the most respected chefs and restaurateurs in the country. Featuring more than 80 recipes and full-color photography throughout, <i>Good Stock</i> weaves together memoir and cookbook in an beautiful and engaging package.<br><br>Sanford, the restaurant D'Amato opened in 1989 and sold to his longtime chef de cuisine in December 2012, has been one of the highest-rated restaurants in America over the past 20 years, earning accolades from <i>Bon App�tit</i>, <i>Gourmet</i>, <i>Food &amp; Wine</i>, <i>Esquire</i>, <i>Wine Spectator</i>, <i>Zagat Guide</i>, and the James Beard Foundation. D'Amato has cooked for the Dalai Lama and the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics, and was one of 12 chefs chosen by Julia Child herself to cook for her 80th birthday celebration. The story of Sanford and Sandy D'Amato is in part the story of America's embrace of fine dining and its acceptance of chefs as master craftsmen.<br><br>Over the past quarter century, America has seen a rise in the prominence of "celebrity chefs," to the extent that it's difficult to remember a time when becoming a chef was considered a backup plan more than a craft. That transformation began in the 1970s, right around when Sanford D'Amato was studying at the fabled Culinary Institute of America. This was a time when American cooks were by and large being frozen out by French chefs who didn't believe the Americans had what it took to create great cuisine. D'Amato, through persistence, skill, and the help of his mentor, Chef Peter Von Erp, became the first American cook at Le Veau d'Or and worked under Chef Roland Chenus through the groundbreaking opening of Le Chantilly. Soon the heyday of classic French cuisine began to waned, as rising chefs like D'Amato began leading the spread "New American" dining.<br><br>To D'Amato, though, the Midwest always signified home. His culinary inventiveness was inspired in part by his childhood home, located above his grandparents' grocery store on the lower east side of Milwaukee. It was a small apartment constantly filled with the sights of carefully prepared delicacies, the smells of rich foods on the simmer, and the many tastes of generations-old Italian recipes. Drawing on this influence, as well as his rigorous training in classic French technique, D'Amato eventually opened Sanford in the same space his grandparents' grocery store occupied.<br><br>In telling his story, D'Amato studs his narrative with 80 of his favorite recipes. The book features both personal photos from his background and career as well as beautiful images of finished recipes.<br><br>Readers of <i>Good Stock</i> will come to believe, as D'Amato does, that to create great food, it doesn't matter if you're preparing a grilled hot dog or pan-roasted monkfish-- what matters is that you treat all dishes with equal love, soul, and respect, and try to elevate each dish to its ultimate level of flavor. <i>Good Stock</i> combines Midwestern charm with international appeal as the perfect book for aspiring chefs, culinary students, and foodies everywhere.</p><p><b>Sanford D'Amato</b> graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in 1974. In December 1989, he opened Sanford Restaurant on the former site of his father and grandfather&#x2019;s grocery store. It has long been recognized as one of the most respected and top-ranked restaurants in the nation.<br>It was quite a few years before I saw Julia Child again (in person) after Le Veau d&#x2019;Or about 15 to be more precise. It was six months into our first year at Sanford, and I was a cofounder of the original American Institute of Wine and Food (AIWF) chapter in Milwaukee. We had planned a series of events, and the main part of the festivities, scheduled for September 4 to 7 of 1990, was to accompany Julia around the state to showcase the bounty of Wisconsin. Her first visit to the state was to conclude with the chapter&#x2019;s inaugural dinner at Sanford on her last night.<br><br>After several days of stops around the state, we were humming along on the return flight when Julia&#x2019;s aide, Gabrielle, called me to the jet&#x2019;s window.<br><br> Sandy what is that?&#x201d; she asked.<br><br>I peeked out. Oh my God! It&#x2019;s the Wienermobile! This is great! They sent the Wienermobile to pick us up!&#x201d; I was enraptured, until Gabrielle replied, I don&#x2019;t think so.&#x201d;<br><br>A flush of fear crossed my mind. Would this be the second time I missed the Wienermobile?<br><br>When I was about five years old working (hanging out) at my dad&#x2019;s grocery, the Wienermobile used to make unannounced stops at local stores to promote their products. As it pulled up in front of our store, I jumped up on the front radiator to look out the window and saw the door rise. Out strode Little Oscar, all four and a half feet, dressed in his signature floppy-hatted chef outfit. He was headed for our front door when I panicked and ran screaming to the back room of the store. The rest of the neighborhood kids got a tour of the Wienermobile along with complimentary official wiener whistles. I always regretted missing my chance.<br><br>It seemed like the sun rose, as Julia leaned toward the window and said, I think I&#x2019;d like a ride in that wiener bus.&#x201d; Julia, where have you been all my life? And so transpired as surreal an experience as I&#x2019;ve ever had: riding down I-94 in the Wienermobile with Julia Child, as the Oscar Mayer theme song blasted through the interior and exterior speakers. We blew along with our de rigueur wiener whistles, as drivers in passing cars honked and waved.<br><br>As we pulled up to our destination, the Pfister Hotel, a large, wiener-curious crowd had already gathered, and as the DeLorean-style flip-up door rose, Julia majestically strode out it was a vision of worlds colliding. The crowds, with their gaping mouths, surely thought this was the largest chef that had ever walked out of the Wienermobile. I think the aura of the Wienermobile even won Gabrielle over.<br><br>The most inspirational part of being with Julia for that trip was watching her passively educate everyone around her with the intuitive questions she asked. She had the enthusiasm of a food reporter and recorder, and as soon as she asked a question, I would think, Of course! Why didn&#x2019;t I ask that? It is the same commonsense brilliance that any great chef has when they produce a dish that is so simple and delicious that everyone chides themselves for not coming up with it. She had an inexhaustible need for knowledge and was always learning a consummate professional.<br></p><h2>The Persian Always Meows Twice (A Cat Groomer Mystery)</h2><p><i>Cat lovers are thrilled to welcome an expert groomer to the picturesque town of Chadwick.

Five hours and five thousand rounds of ammunition later, three SWAT team members and three Black Panthers lay wounded. From a tactical standpoint, the Los Angeles Police Department (LAPD) considered the encounter a disaster. For the Panthers and the community that supported them, the shootout symbolized a victory. A key contributor to that victory was the nineteen-year-old rank-and-file member of the BPP Wayne Pharr.</p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <i>Nine Lives of a Black Panther</i> tells Wayne&#x2019;s riveting story of the Los Angeles branch of the BPP and gives a blow-by-blow account of how it prepared for and survived the massive military-style attack. Because of his dedication to the black liberation struggle, Wayne was hunted, beaten, and almost killed by the LAPD in four separate events. Here he reveals how the branch survived attacks such as these, and also why BPP cofounder Huey P. Newton expelled the entire Southern California chapter and deemed it &#x201c;too dangerous to remain a part of the national organization.&#x201d; </p><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The Los Angeles branch was the proving ground for some of the most beloved and colorful characters in Panther lore, including Bunchy Carter, Masai Hewitt, Geronimo &#x201c;ji-Jaga&#x201d; Pratt, and Elaine Brown. <i>Nine Lives </i>fills in a missing piece of Black Panther history, while making clear why black Los Angeles was home to two of the most devastating riots in the history of urban America. But it also eloquently relates one man&#x2019;s triumph over police terror, internal warfare, and personal demons.

Parker is a pseudonym for Tom Holt. He was born in London in 1961. At Oxford he studied bar billiards, ancient Greek agriculture and the care and feeding of small, temperamental Japanese motorcycle engines; interests which led him, perhaps inevitably, to qualify as a solicitor and emigrate to Somerset, where he specialized in death and taxes for seven years before going straight in 1995. He lives in Chard, Somerset, with his wife and daughter."Parker's acerbic wit and knowledge of human nature are a delight to read as he explores the way conflict is guided, in equal measure, by the brilliance and unerring foolishness of humanity . . . .

All phone numbers, references to ex-girlfriends, "false starts," and embarrassing experiments with unfamiliar drawing media have been generously excised to present the reader with the most pleasant and colorful sketchbook reading experience available. Included are Ware's frustrated doodles for his book covers, angry personal assaults on friends, half-finished comic strips, and lengthy and tiresome fulminations of personal disappointments both social and sexual, as well as his now-beloved drawings of the generally miserable inhabitants of the city of Chicago. All in all, a necessary volume for fans of fine art, water-based media, and personal diatribe.

The handsomely designed volume gathers hundreds of portraits, watercolors, unfinished comics pages, and other artwork. Life drawings with detailed shading display a radically different style from the simple line-work of Jimmy Corrigan (2000), Ware&#x2019;s chef d&#x2019;oeuvre (thus far), while still lifes and cityscapes show the mechanical precision of his comic strips. Cruel self-portraits and strips entitled &#x201c;I Am Filled with Despair&#x201d; and &#x201c;Yesterday Was a Terrible Day&#x201d; suggest that the harsh worldview of Ware&#x2019;s graphic novels is more than a literary device for him. --Gordon Flagg</p><h2>Blessed Are Those Who Thirst: Hanne Wilhelmsen Book Two (2) (A Hanne Wilhelmsen Novel)</h2><p>The second book in Edgar-nominated Anne Holt's international bestselling mystery series featuring detective Hanne Wilhelmsen, last seen in <i>Blind Goddess</i>.<br><br>IT is only the beginning of May but in Oslo a brutal heat wave has coincided with an alarming increase in violent crime.

How does the killer have access to immigrant data?<br> <br>Meanwhile, as the trail heats up, the victim of a horrific unsolved rape case and her father have each decided to take justice into their own hands.

Don&#x2019;t you think we have enough of a slog every day of the week?&#x201d;<br> <br>Police Attorney H�kon Sand was standing in the doorway. His jeans were new, and for once he was wearing a jacket and tie. His jacket was slightly too large and his tie was a touch too broad, but nevertheless he looked reasonably put together. Apart from the hemline on his jeans. Hanne Wilhelmsen couldn&#x2019;t resist leaning in front of him, speedily tucking the superfluous centimeters inside so they couldn&#x2019;t be seen.<br> <br>&#x201c;You shouldn&#x2019;t walk about with the turn-up on the outside.&#x201d; She gave a friendly smile and stood up. She smoothed her hand down his arm with a light, almost tender, movement.<br> <br>&#x201c;There. Now you&#x2019;re fantastic. Are you going to court?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;No,&#x201d; replied the prosecution attorney, who, despite the well-meaning gesture, felt embarrassed. Why did the detective inspector have to draw attention to his lack of fashion sense? She could have saved herself the trouble of doing that, he thought, though he said something different.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve a dinner date right after work. But what about you, why were you here?&#x201d;<br> <br>A pale green folder hung poised in the air before landing precisely on Hanne Wilhelmsen&#x2019;s blotter.<br> <br>&#x201c;I just received this,&#x201d; he went on. &#x201c;Strange case. There have been no reports of either dismembered people or animals in our area.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I did an extra shift in the crime section,&#x201d; she explained, leaving the folder untouched. &#x201c;They&#x2019;re struggling with illness down there right now.&#x201d;<br> <br>The police prosecution attorney, a dark-haired and reasonably good-looking man whose temples were grayer than his thirty-five years would suggest, flopped onto the visitor&#x2019;s chair. He removed his glasses and sat polishing them with the end of his tie. The spectacles did not become particularly clean, but the tie became decidedly more crumpled.<br> <br>&#x201c;The case has been assigned to the two of us. If there is a case, that is. There&#x2019;s no victim, no one has heard anything, no one has seen anything. Odd. There are some pictures in there.&#x201d;<br> <br>He pointed toward the folder.<br> <br>&#x201c;I don&#x2019;t need those, thanks.&#x201d; She waved dismissively. &#x201c;I was there. It really didn&#x2019;t look very pretty.<br> <br>&#x201c;But you know,&#x201d; she continued, leaning toward him, &#x201c;if all of that turns out to be human blood, then there must have been two or three people killed in there. I&#x2019;m inclined to think there are some young hooligans having some fun with us.&#x201d;<br> <br>The theory didn&#x2019;t seem improbable. The Oslo police were in the middle of their worst spring ever. In the course of six weeks, three murders had been visited upon the city, and at least one of these seemed unsolvable. There had been no fewer than sixteen cases of rape reported in the same period, with seven of these becoming the object of enormous media attention. The fact that one of the victims was a member of Parliament for the Christian Democrats, on her way home from an evening committee meeting when she was brutally assaulted in the Palace Park, inflamed public disappointment in the lack of progress made by the police. Well aided by the tabloid press, the frustrated citizens of Oslo had started to protest against the Oslo police&#x2019;s apparent inability to act. The elongated, curved building sat there at Gr�nlandsleiret 44, gray and unshakable, seemingly unmoved by all the merciless criticism. Its inhabitants arrived at work in the mornings with shoulders drawn up and eyes downcast. They went home again far too late each day, their backs bent and nothing more to show for their daily toil than still more confirmed dead ends. The weather gods played around tauntingly with intense summer temperatures. The awnings were pulled right down, in vain, over all the windows on the south fa�ade of the enormous building, making it appear both blind and deaf. The interior remained just as stifling. Nothing helped, and nothing seemed to show the way out of a professional blind alley that simply increased with every new case entered into the huge data systems. They should be of assistance but instead appeared hostile, almost mocking, each morning when they spewed out their lists of unsolved cases.<br> <br>&#x201c;What a springtime,&#x201d; Hanne Wilhelmsen said, sighing theatrically. With a look of resignation, she raised her eyebrows and contemplated her superior officer. Her eyes were not especially large, but they were amazingly blue, with a distinctive black edge around the iris making them appear darker than they were. Her hair was dark brown and quite short. From time to time she tugged at it absentmindedly, as though she actually wished it were long and thought it would hasten its growth if she helped it along a little. Her mouth was generous, with a cupid&#x2019;s bow that didn&#x2019;t simply dip down from the top but also met its twin from below, like a hesitant cleft lip that had changed its mind, thus forming a sensuous curve instead of a defect. Above her left eye she bore a scar parallel to her eyebrow. It was pale pink and not particularly old.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never seen it like this. Though I&#x2019;ve only been here for eleven years. Kaldbakken has been here for thirty. He hasn&#x2019;t experienced anything like it, either.&#x201d;<br> <br>She pulled at her T-shirt and gave it a shake.<br> <br>&#x201c;And this heat doesn&#x2019;t make it any better. The whole city is on the move every single night. A spell of rain right now would be just the thing. That would at least keep people indoors.&#x201d;<br> <br>They sat there for too long, talking about everything and nothing. They were friendly colleagues who always had something to talk about but who didn&#x2019;t know very much about each other all the same. Other than that they both enjoyed their work, that they took it seriously, and that one of them was more competent than the other. That didn&#x2019;t do much for the relationship between them. She was a highly skilled officer with a reputation that had always been good but following a dramatic case the previous autumn had now reached legendary heights. He had loafed around in the police station as a second-rate lawyer for more than six years, never outstanding, never brilliant. Still, he had built up a reputation for himself as both conscientious and hardworking. He too had played a decisive role in the same sensational case. His reputation was edging more in the direction of solid and dependable than what it had been before: rather uninteresting.<br> <br>Perhaps they complemented each other. Perhaps it was more the fact they were never in competition that enabled them to work so well together. However, it was a curious friendship, restricted by the walls of the police station. Police Attorney H�kon Sand was genuinely sorry about that and several times had endeavored to alter the situation. Some time ago he had suggested in passing that they meet up for dinner. The rejection had been so blunt it would be a long time before he made the effort again.<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, well, we&#x2019;ll let the blood-soaked woodshed lie. I&#x2019;ve got other things to do.&#x201d;<br> <br>The police officer slapped a heap of files sitting in a tray beside the window.<br> <br>&#x201c;So have we all,&#x201d; the attorney retorted, before walking the twenty meters along the corridor to return to his own office.<br> <br>* * *<br> <br>&#x201c;Why have you never brought me here before?&#x201d;<br> <br>The woman sitting on the opposite side of the narrow table smiled reproachfully as she squeezed her companion&#x2019;s hand.<br> <br>&#x201c;I didn&#x2019;t really know whether you liked this type of food,&#x201d; the man responded, clearly pleased at how successful the meal had been.<br> <br>The Pakistani waiters, immaculately dressed and with diction indicating they had been born at Aker Hospital rather than a delivery room in Karachi, had amiably steered them through the menu.<br> <br>&#x201c;Slightly inconvenient location,&#x201d; he added. &#x201c;But otherwise it&#x2019;s one of my favorite restaurants. Good food, top-notch service, and prices to suit a public servant.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;So you&#x2019;ve been here often.&#x201d; She paused. &#x201c;Who with, then?&#x201d;<br> <br>He didn&#x2019;t answer but instead raised his glass to hide how mortified he was by the question. All his women had been here. The very short-lived, far fewer than he liked to consider, and the two or three he had endured for a few months. Every time he had been thinking of her. What it would be like to sit here with Karen Borg. And now they were sitting here.<br> <br>&#x201c;Don&#x2019;t think about the ones who were first. Concentrate on being last,&#x201d; he said with a grin after a moment&#x2019;s thought.<br> <br>&#x201c;Elegantly put,&#x201d; she replied, but her voice had adopted a trace of . . . not coldness, but a kind of coolness that always terrified him out of his wits. That he could never learn.<br> <br>Karen Borg didn&#x2019;t want to talk about the future. For almost four months she had been meeting him regularly, up to several times a week. They ate together and went to the theater. They went for walks in the forest, and they made love as soon as they had the opportunity. Which was not too often. She was married, so her apartment was out of the question. Her husband knew they were having an affair, she said, but they had decided not to burn their bridges until they were certain that was what they wanted. Of course they could go to his place, something he suggested every time they were together. But she turned him down flat.<br> <br>&#x201c;If I come home with you, then I&#x2019;ve made a choice,&#x201d; she declared illogically.<br> <br>H�kon Sand believed the choice of making love with him was a far more dramatic decision than the choice of venue, but it was no use. The waiter appeared with the check twenty seconds after H�kon had dropped a hint. It was presented according to old-fashioned etiquette, neatly folded on a plate placed in front of him. Karen Borg grabbed it, and he couldn&#x2019;t muster the energy to protest. It was one thing that she earned five times as much as he did and quite another to be continually reminded of that. When the AmEx gold card was returned, he got up and held her chair for her. The strikingly handsome waiter had ordered a taxicab, and she snuggled up to her lover in the backseat.<br> <br>&#x201c;I suppose you&#x2019;re going straight home,&#x201d; he said, a precaution against his own disappointment.<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes, it&#x2019;s a working day tomorrow,&#x201d; she confirmed. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll meet up again soon. I&#x2019;ll phone you.&#x201d;<br> <br>Once she was out the taxi door, she leaned back in again to give him a gentle kiss.<br> <br>&#x201c;Thanks for a lovely evening,&#x201d; she said softly, smiling briefly as she withdrew from the cab once again.<br> <br>Sighing, he gave the taxi driver a new address. It was situated in a completely different part of the city, allowing plenty of time to feel the sharp little stab of pain he always experienced after his evenings with Karen Borg.</p><h2>How to Read Freud</h2><p><p><strong>Intent upon letting the reader experience the pleasure and intellectual stimulation in reading these classic authors, the <em>How to Read</em> series provides a context and an explanation that will facilitate and enrich your understanding of texts vital to the canon.</strong></p> Approaching the writing of major intellectuals, artists, and philosophers need no longer be daunting. <em>How to Read</em> is a new sort of introduction--a personal master class in reading--that brings you face to face with the work of some of the most influential and challenging writers in history.

Everyone knows your husband turns every copper over to you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Look who&#x2019;s talking. Your husband doesn&#x2019;t get to sneeze without your permission!

The fire in the wood-burning stove in the corner crackled and danced, keeping the pub toasty and bathing everything in a warm light. Condensation froze against the glass windows in refined, complex patterns that blurred the view of the outside. Guests sat by threes and fours around low tables in g��pa, relaxed and convivial, enjoying small plates of roasted peanuts dipped in taro sauce that sharpened the taste of alcohol.<br> <br>Ordinarily, an entertainer in this venue could not expect a cessation in the constant murmur of conversation. But gradually, the buzzing of competing voices died out. For now, at least, there was no distinction between merchants&#x2019; stable boys from Wolf&#x2019;s Paw, scholars&#x2019; servant girls from Haan, low-level government clerks sneaking away from the office for the afternoon, laborers resting after a morning&#x2019;s honest work, shopkeepers taking a break while their spouses watched the store, maids and matrons out for errands and meeting friends&#x2014;all were just members of an audience enthralled by the storyteller standing at the center of the tavern.<br> <br>He took a sip of foamy beer, put the mug down, slapped his hands a few times against his long, draping sleeves, and continued:<br> <br>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;the Hegemon unsheathed Na-aro�nna then, and King Mocri stepped back to admire the great sword: the soul-taker, the head-remover, the hope-dasher. Even the moon seemed to lose her luster next to the pure glow of this weapon.<br> <br>&#x201c;That is a beautiful blade,&#x201d; said King Mocri, champion of Gan. &#x201c;It surpasses other swords as Consort Mira excels all other women.&#x201d;<br> <br>The Hegemon looked at Mocri contemptuously, his double-pupils glinting. &#x201c;Do you praise the weapon because you think I hold an unfair advantage? Come, let us switch swords, and I have no doubt I will still defeat you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Not at all,&#x201d; said Mocri. &#x201c;I praise the weapon because I believe you know a warrior by his weapon of choice. What is better in life than to meet an opponent truly worthy of your skill?&#x201d;<br> <br>The Hegemon&#x2019;s face softened. &#x201c;I wish you had not rebelled, Mocri.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&#x201d;<br> <br>In a corner barely illuminated by the glow of the stove, two boys and a girl huddled around a table. Dressed in hempen robes and tunics that were plain but well-made, they appeared to be the children of farmers or perhaps the servants of a well-to-do merchant&#x2019;s family. The older boy was about twelve, fair-skinned and well proportioned. His eyes were gentle and his dark hair, naturally curly, was tied into a single messy bun at the top of his head. Across the table from him was a girl about a year younger, also fair-skinned and curly-haired&#x2014;though she wore her hair loose and let the strands cascade around her pretty, round face. The corners of her mouth were curled up in a slight smile as she scanned the room with lively eyes shaped like the body of the graceful dyran, taking in everything with avid interest. Next to her was a younger boy about nine, whose complexion was darker and whose hair was straight and black. The older children sat on either side of him, keeping him penned between the table and the wall. The mischievous glint in his roaming eyes and his constant fidgeting offered a hint as to why. The similarity in the shapes of their features suggested they were siblings.<br> <br>&#x201c;Isn&#x2019;t this great?&#x201d; whispered the younger boy. &#x201c;I bet Master Ruthi still thinks we&#x2019;re imprisoned in our rooms, enduring our punishment.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Phyro,&#x201d; said the older boy, a slight frown on his face, &#x201c;you know this is only a temporary reprieve. Tonight, we each still have to write three essays about how Kon Fiji&#x2019;s Morality applies to our misbehavior, how youthful energy must be tempered by education, and how&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shhhh&#x2014;&#x201d; the girl said. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m trying to hear the storyteller! Don&#x2019;t lecture, Timu. You already agreed that there&#x2019;s no difference between playing first and then studying, on the one hand, and studying first and then playing, on the other. It&#x2019;s called &#x2018;time-shifting.&#x2019; &#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m beginning to think that this &#x2018;time-shifting&#x2019; idea of yours would be better called &#x2018;time-wasting,&#x2019; &#x201d; said Timu, the older brother. &#x201c;You and Phyro were wrong to make jokes about Master Kon Fiji&#x2014;and I should have been more severe with you. You should accept your punishment gracefully.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Oh, wait until you find out what Th�ra and I&#x2014;mmf&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>The girl had clamped a hand over the younger boy&#x2019;s mouth. &#x201c;Let&#x2019;s not trouble Timu with too much knowledge, right?&#x201d; Phyro nodded, and Th�ra let go.<br> <br>The young boy wiped his mouth. &#x201c;Your hand is salty! Ptui!&#x201d; Then he turned back to Timu, his older brother. &#x201c;Since you&#x2019;re so eager to write the essays, Toto-tika, I&#x2019;m happy to yield my share to you so that you can write six instead of three. Your essays are much more to Master Ruthi&#x2019;s taste anyway.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That&#x2019;s ridiculous! The only reason I agreed to sneak away with you and Th�ra is because as the eldest, it&#x2019;s my responsibility to look after you, and you promised you would take your punishment later&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Elder Brother, I&#x2019;m shocked!&#x201d; Phyro put on a serious mien that looked like an exact copy of their strict tutor&#x2019;s when he was about to launch into a scolding lecture. &#x201c;Is it not written in Sage Kon Fiji&#x2019;s Tales of Filial Devotion that the younger brother should offer the choicest specimens in a basket of plums to the elder brother as a token of his respect? Is it also not written that an elder brother should try to protect the younger brother from difficult tasks beyond his ability, since it is the duty of the stronger to defend the weaker? The essays are uncrackable nuts to me, but juicy plums to you. I am trying to live as a good Moralist with my offer. I thought you&#x2019;d be pleased.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;That is&#x2014;you cannot&#x2014;&#x201d; Timu was not as practiced at this particular subspecies of the art of debate as his younger brother. His face grew red, and he glared at Phyro. &#x201c;If only you would direct your cleverness to actual schoolwork.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You should be happy that Hudo-tika has done the assigned reading for once,&#x201d; said Th�ra, who had been trying to maintain a straight face as the brothers argued. &#x201c;Now please be quiet, both of you; I want to hear this.&#x201d;<br> <br>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;slammed Na-aro�nna down, and Mocri met it with his ironwood shield, reinforced with cruben scales. It was as if Fithow�o had clashed his spear against Mount Kiji, or if Kana had slammed her fiery fist against the surface of the sea. Better yet, let me chant for you a portrait of that fight:<br> <br>On this side, the champion of Gan, born and bred on Wolf&#x2019;s Paw;<br> <br>On that side, the Hegemon of Dara, last scion of Cocru&#x2019;s marshals.<br> <br>One is the pride of an island&#x2019;s spear-wielding multitudes;<br> <br>The other is Fithow�o, the God of War, incarnate.<br> <br>Will the Doubt-Ender end all doubt as to who is master of Dara?<br> <br>Or will Goremaw finally meet a blood-meal he cannot swallow?<br> <br>Sword is met with sword, cudgel with shield.<br> <br>The ground quakes as dual titans leap, smash, clash, and thump.<br> <br>For nine days and nine nights they fought on that desolate hill,<br> <br>And the gods of Dara gathered over the whale&#x2019;s way to judge the strength of their will.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>As he chanted, the storyteller banged a coconut husk against a large kitchen spoon to simulate the sounds of sword clanging against shield; he leapt about, whipping his long sleeves this way and that to conjure the martial dance of legendary heroes in the flickering firelight of the pub. As his voice rose and fell, urgent one moment, languorous the next, the audience was transported to another time and place.<br> <br>.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;After nine days, both the Hegemon and King Mocri were exhausted. After parrying another strike from the Doubt-Ender, Mocri took a step back and stumbled over a rock. He fell, his shield and sword splayed out to the sides. With one more step, the Hegemon would be able to bash in his skull or lop off his head.<br> <br>&#x201c;No!&#x201d; Phyro couldn&#x2019;t help himself. Timu and Th�ra, equally absorbed by the tale, didn&#x2019;t shush him.<br> <br>The storyteller nodded appreciatively at the children, and went on.<br> <br>But the Hegemon stayed where he was and waited until Mocri climbed back up, sword and shield at the ready.<br> <br>&#x201c;Why did you not end it just now?&#x201d; asked Mocri, his breathing labored.<br> <br>&#x201c;Because a great man deserves to not have his life end by chance,&#x201d; said the Hegemon, whose breathing was equally labored. &#x201c;The world may not be fair, but we must strive to make it so.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hegemon,&#x201d; said Mocri, &#x201c;I am both glad and sorry to have met you.&#x201d;<br> <br>And they rushed at each other again, with lumbering steps and proud hearts.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;.<br> <br>&#x201c;Now that is the manner of a real hero,&#x201d; whispered Phyro, his tone full of admiration and longing. &#x201c;Hey, Timu and Th�ra, you&#x2019;ve actually met the Hegemon, haven&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Yes&nbsp;.&nbsp;.&nbsp;. but that was a long time ago,&#x201d; Timu whispered back. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t really remember much except that he was really tall, and those strange eyes of his looked terribly fierce. I remember wondering how strong he must have been to be able to wield that huge sword on his back.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;He sounds like a great man,&#x201d; said Phyro. &#x201c;Such honor in every action; such grace to his foes. Too bad he and Da could not&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Shhhh!&#x201d; Th�ra interrupted. &#x201c;Hudo-tika, not so loud! Do you want everyone here to know who we are?&#x201d;<br> <br>Phyro might be a rascal to his older brother, but he respected the authority of his older sister. He lowered his voice. &#x201c;Sorry. He just seems such a brave man. And Mocri, too. I&#x2019;ll have to tell Ada-tika all about this hero from her home island. How come Master Ruthi never taught us anything about Mocri?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;This is just a story,&#x201d; Th�ra said. &#x201c;Fighting nonstop for nine days and nine nights&#x2014;how can you believe that really happened? Think: The storyteller wasn&#x2019;t there, how would he know what the Hegemon and Mocri said?&#x201d; But seeing the disappointment on her little brother&#x2019;s face, she softened her tone. &#x201c;If you want to hear real stories about heroes, I&#x2019;ll tell you later about the time Auntie Soto stopped the Hegemon from hurting Mother and us. I was only three then, but I remember it as though it happened yesterday.&#x201d;<br> <br>Phyro&#x2019;s eyes brightened and he was about to ask for more, but a rough voice broke in.<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ve had just about enough of this ridiculous tale, you insolent fraud!&#x201d;<br> <br>The storyteller stopped in midsentence, shocked at this intrusion into his performance. The tavern patrons turned to look at the speaker. Standing next to the stove, the man was tall, barrel-chested, and as muscular as a stevedore. He was easily the largest person in the pub. A jagged scar that started at his left brow and ended at his right cheek gave his face a fearsome aspect, which was only enhanced by the wolf&#x2019;s-teeth necklace that dangled in front of the thick chest hair that peeked out of the loose lapels of his short robe like a patch of fur. Indeed, the yellow teeth that showed between his sneering lips reminded one of a hungry wolf on the prowl.<br> <br>&#x201c;How dare you fabricate such stories about that crook Mata Zyndu? He tried to thwart Emperor Ragin&#x2019;s righteous march to the throne and caused much needless suffering and desolation. By praising the despicable tyrant Zyndu, you&#x2019;re denigrating the victory of our wise emperor and casting aspersions upon the character of the Dandelion Throne. These are words of treason.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Treason? For telling a few stories?&#x201d; The storyteller was so furious that he started to laugh. &#x201c;Will you next claim that all folk opera troupes are rebels for enacting the rise and fall of old Tiro dynasties? Or that the wise Emperor Ragin is jealous of shadow puppet plays about Emperor Mapid�r�? What a silly man you are!&#x201d;<br> <br>The owners of the Three-Legged Jug, a rotund man of short stature and his equally rotund wife, rushed up between the two to play peacemakers. &#x201c;Masters!

In March 1944 the Japanese Army launched Operation U-Go, an attack on Assam in India intended to inspire a rising by the Indian populace against British rule. The Japanese plan would rely on mobility, infiltration and captured supplies to maintain the momentum of the attack. A month earlier the Japanese had launched Operation Ha-Go, which was intended as a feint to draw British attention away from the Imphal area where the brunt of the U-Go attacks would take place. </p><p>But British forces employed new defensive techniques to counter the Japanese infiltration tactics; forming defensive boxes, supplied by air, they held out against determined Japanese assaults until the Japanese were forced to withdraw, short of supplies. These tactics were again employed on a larger scale when Imphal and Kohima were surrounded during Operation U-Go. </p><p>Kohima (the 'Stalingrad of the East') was the crucial key point to the successful defence of Imphal, and took place in two stages. From 3 to 16 April the Japanese attempted to capture Kohima Ridge, which dominated the road along which the British and Indian troops centred on the Imphal plain were supplied. As the small garrison held out against fierce and repeatedly desperate attempts by the Japanese 31st Division to destroy them, so the British 2nd Division fought to break through and relieve them. </p><p>Then for over two months from 18 April, British and Indian troops counter-attacked in an effort to drive the Japanese from the positions they had already captured that blocked the road to Imphal. The battle ended on June 22 when British and Indian troops from Kohima and Imphal met at Milestone 109, thus ending the siege.</p></p><p>Robert Lyman is the author of one Campaign Series titles: Iraq 1941 (2006).

WHAT ARE YOUR stories? The ones you tell yourself, and the ones told by others. All of us begin somewhere. Though I suppose the truth is that we begin more than once; we begin many times. Over and over, we start our own tales, compose our own stories, whether our lives are short or long. Until at last all our beginnings come down to just one end, and the tale of who we are is done.<br> <br>This is the first story I ever heard about myself: that I came into this world before my time. And that my coming was so sudden, hot, and swift, it carried everything before it away, including my mother&#x2019;s life.<br> <br>Full of confusion was the day of my birth, of portents, and of omens. Just at daybreak, a flock of white birds flew across the face of the sun. Its rising light stained their wings bloodred. This was an omen of life taking flight.<br> <br>At full noon, every single tree in every single orchard on my father&#x2019;s estate burst into bloom at once, in spite of the fact that it was October. This was an omen of life&#x2019;s arrival.<br> <br>At dusk, a great storm arose, catching everyone by surprise. My mother was in her garden, the one she planted and tended with her own two hands, when two claps of thunder, one from the east and the other from the west, met above her head in a great collision of sound. The earth shook beneath her feet. Crying out, my mother tumbled to the ground. What this portended nobody ever did decide, because it was at precisely this moment that I declared my intention to be born.<br> <br>Fortunately for my mother, she was not alone. The healer, Old Mathilde, was with her, as she often was when my father was away from home. Just how old Old Mathilde is, no one really knows. But no matter what her years, she was strong and hale enough to lift my mother up and carry her indoors&#x2014;through the gate in the garden wall and around the side of the house, up the steps to the front door, and across the great hall. Then, finally, up a wide set of stairs from the great hall to the second floor. By the time Old Mathilde reached my mother&#x2019;s chamber, it was storming in earnest, and she, herself, was breathing hard. The wind wailed like a banshee. Hailstones clattered against the roof with a sound like military drums.<br> <br>Old Mathilde set my mother gently on the bed, paused to catch her breath. Then she summoned Susanne, who worked in the kitchen, instructing her to bring hot water and soft towels. But when Mathilde went to stir up the coals, the wind got there first, screaming down the chimney, putting out the fire. Not content to do this in my mother&#x2019;s room alone, the wind then extinguished every other fire throughout my father&#x2019;s great stone house by the sea, until not so much as a candle remained lit. All the servants quaked in fear. The women buried their heads beneath their aprons, and the men behind their arms, for nobody could remember such an event ever occurring before.<br> <br>And so it was first in shadow, and then in darkness, that Old Mathilde and my mother strove to bring me into the world. Just before midnight, I arrived. At my coming, the storm ceased as suddenly as it had begun. A great silence filled the great stone house. Into it came the loud voice of the sea, and then my mother&#x2019;s quiet voice, asking Old Mathilde to place me in her waiting arms. She asked this just as the clocks throughout the house began to strike midnight: the only hour in all the world that begins in one day and ends in another. This was the moment I knew my mother&#x2019;s touch for the first and only time.<br> <br>And this is the story Old Mathilde has told me each and every time I asked her to: that, with my green eyes, I gazed up, and with her green eyes, my mother gazed back down. She ran one hand across my head, her fingers lingering on my bright red hair, for this, too, was the exact same shade as her own. Then she bent her head and pressed a kiss upon my brow. I carry the mark of it to this day, the faintest smudge of rose just at my hairline.<br> <br>&#x201c;Mathilde,&#x201d; my mother said then, and with the sounding of her own name, Old Mathilde understood what my coming into the world before my time would cost. For she recognized the sound my mother&#x2019;s voice made&#x2014;a sound that was both less and more than it had ever been before.<br> <br>No one is better at understanding the world than Old Mathilde, at being able to see things for what they truly are. This is what makes her such a good healer, I suppose. For how can you mend a thing, any thing, if you cannot truly see what is wrong? Some things, of course, cannot be healed, no matter how much you want them to be, no matter how hard you try. Old Mathilde was not a magician. She was simply very good at helping wishes come true.<br> <br>&#x201c;Will you hear a wish?&#x201d; my mother asked now.<br> <br>Just for an instant, Old Mathilde closed her eyes, as if summoning the strength to hear what would come. For my mother was asking to bestow the most powerful wish there is, one that is a birth and death wish, all at the same time. Then Old Mathilde opened her eyes and gave the only answer she could, also the one that was in her heart.<br> <br>&#x201c;I will grant whatever you wish that lies within my power, Constanze, my child.&#x201d;<br> <br>Constanze d&#x2019;Este. That was my mother&#x2019;s name.<br> <br>&#x201c;I wish for you to be my daughter&#x2019;s godmother,&#x201d; Constanze d&#x2019;Este replied. &#x201c;Love her for me, care for her when I am gone, for I fear her father will do neither one. When he looks at her, he will not find joy in the color of her hair and eyes. He will not see the way that I live on. Instead, he will see only that she came too soon, and that her arrival carried me out of this life.<br> <br>&#x201c;Besides, he is a man and a great lord. He wished for his first child to be a boy.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;What you wish for is easily granted,&#x201d; Old Mathilde said. &#x201c;For I have loved this child with all my heart since she was no more than a dream in yours. As for Etienne . . .&#x201d; Etienne de Brabant. That is my father&#x2019;s name. &#x201c;I suppose a man may be a great lord and a great fool all at once. What shall I call her, while I&#x2019;m loving her so much?&#x201d;<br> <br>At this point in the story, Old Mathilde always does the same thing: She smiles. Not because the circumstances she&#x2019;s relating are particularly happy, but because smiling is what my mother did.<br> <br>&#x201c;Call her by whatever name you think best,&#x201d; she replied. &#x201c;For you will raise her, not I.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then I will give her your name,&#x201d; Old Mathilde said. &#x201c;For she should have more of her mother than just the color of her hair and eyes, and a memory she is too young to know how to hold.&#x201d;<br> <br>And so I was named Constanze, after my mother. And no sooner had this been decided, than my mother died. Old Mathilde sat beside the bed, her eyes seeing the two of us together even in the dark, until my mother&#x2019;s lips turned pale, her arms grew cold, and the clouds outside the window parted to reveal a spangle of high night stars. Not once in all that time, so Old Mathilde has always claimed, did I so much as stir or cry.<br> <br>When the slim and curving sickle of the moon had reached the top of the window, then begun its slide back down the sky, Old Mathilde got up from her chair and lifted me gently from my mother&#x2019;s arms. She carried me downstairs to the great open fireplace in the kitchen. Holding me in the crook of one arm, she took the longest poker she could find and stirred up the coals.<br> <br>Not even such a storm as had descended upon us that night could altogether put out the kitchen fire&#x2014;the fire that is the heart of any house. Once the coals were glowing as they should, Old Mathilde wrapped me in a towel of red flannel, took the largest of our soup kettles down from its peg, tucked me inside it, and nestled the pot among the embers so that I might grow warm once more.<br> <br>As she did, I began to cry for the very first time. And at this, as if the sound of my voice startled them back into existence, all the other fires throughout the great stone house came back to life. Flurries of sparks shot straight up every chimney, scattering into the air like red-hot fireflies.<br> <br>In this way, I earned a second name that night, the one that people use and remember, in spite of the fact that the name Constanze is a perfectly fine one. Nobody has ever called me that, not even Old Mathilde. Instead, she calls me by the name I was given for the coals that kept me warm, for the fires I brought back to life with the sound of my own voice.<br> <br>Child of cinders.

Beginning with an extended analysis of irony as an essentially dramatic device, Esolen explores those manifestations of irony that appear prominently in Christian thinking and art: ironies of time (for Christians believe in divine Providence, but live in a world whose moments pass away); ironies of power (for Christians believe in an almighty God who took on human flesh, and whose &#x201c;weakness&#x201d; is stronger than our greatest enemy, death); ironies of love (for man seldom knows whom to love, or how, or even whom it is that in the depths of his heart he loves best); and the figure of the Child (for Christians ever hear the warning voice of their Savior, who says that unless we become like unto one of these little ones, we shall not enter the Kingdom of God). Esolen&#x2019;s finely wrought study draws from Augustine (Confessions), Dante (The Divine Comedy), Shakespeare (The Tempest), and Tolkien (&#x201c;Leaf, By Niggle&#x201d;); Francois Mauriac (A Kiss for the Leper), Milton (Paradise Lost), and Alessandro Manzoni (The Betrothed); the poems of George Herbert and Gerard Manley Hopkins, and Edmund Spenser (Amoretti); Charles Dickens (A Christmas Carol), Dostoyevsky (The Brothers Karamazov), and the anonymous author of the medieval poem Pearl, among other works. Readers who treasure the Christian literary tradition should not miss this illuminating book.</p><p>Anthony Esolen, Professor of English at Providence College, is the editor and translator of the Modern Library edition of Dante&#x2019;s <i>Divine Comedy.</i> He has published scholarly articles on Spenser, Shakespeare, Dante, and Tasso in various journals and is a senior editor and frequent contributor to <i>Touchstone Magazine.</i>Widely regarded as the exclusive property of sophisticated skeptics, irony yields surprising treasures to a devout Christian. And in reclaiming irony as a mode of divine revelation, Esolen rehabilitates a body of Christian literature often reduced to deceptive illusions by modernist critics. In Shakespearean plays&#x2014;for instance&#x2014;in which au courant theorists see only the corrosive ironies of power politics, Esolen discovers a joyfully ironic perspective on how the rhythms of mere time resound with the harmonies of eternity. Similarly, while other readers see in Dostoevsky's probing fiction only the grim realities that compel any mature adult to reject God, Esolen discerns in the narratives of Alyosha Karamazov and Father Zossima the ironically superior wisdom of childlike faith. Christian irony likewise transforms the apparent contradictions of Spenser's erotic poetry into an astonishing affirmation of holy love. The artistry of Dante (Esolen's specialty), Hopkins, Herbert, and a dozen other authors likewise glows with new radiance as their ironies awaken readers to the hidden powers of God's grace. Even the ironies of pagan authors such as Virgil, Sophocles, and Lucretius look richer from a perspective of Christian faith that recognizes the redemptive influence of an Unnamed God. A bracing challenge to the orthodoxies of literary secularism. Christensen, Bryce <br><i>Copyright � American Library Association.

While a student at the School of Visual Arts, Chris Stein photographed the downtown New York scene of the early &#x2019;70s, where he met Deborah Harry and cofounded Blondie. Their blend of punk, dance, and hip-hop spawned a totally new sound, and Stein&#x2019;s photographs helped establish Harry as an international fashion and music icon. In photos and stories direct from Stein, brilliant writer of hits like "Rapture" and "Heart of Glass," this book provides a fascinating snapshot of the period before and during Blondie&#x2019;s huge rise, by someone who was part of and who helped to shape the early punk music scene&#x2014;at CBGB, Andy Warhol&#x2019;s Factory, and early Bowery. Stars such as David Bowie, the Ramones, Joan Jett, and Iggy Pop were part of Stein&#x2019;s world, as were fascinating downtown characters like Jean-Michel Basquiat, Richard Hell, Stephen Sprouse, Anya Phillips, Divine, and many others. As captured by one of its greatest artists and instigators, and designed by Shepard Fairey, this book is a must-have celebration of the new-wave and punk scene, whose influence on music and fashion is just as relevant today as it was four decades ago.</p><p>Chris Stein&#x2019;s work has been featured in galleries and press around the world.

Glenn O&#x2019;Brien is the author of How to Be a Man and writes about art, fashion, love, and philosophy.&#x201c;Since Blondie formed 40 years ago, one thing has remained constant: if the band&#x2019;s co-founder Chris Stein isn&#x2019;t onstage with a guitar slung around his neck, chances are he&#x2019;s off somewhere with a camera, taking pictures. Now, the results of his four-decade-long hobby have been compiled in a new book, <i>Chris Stein/Negative: Me, Blondie, and the Advent of Punk</i>...Though the photographs in the book span the band&#x2019;s four decades, they&#x2019;re rooted mostly in the punk scene that emerged in the &#x2019;70s and &#x2019;80s, paralleling Blondie&#x2019;s rise. Looking at them, it&#x2019;s easy to imagine how much fun the duo had not just making pictures, but also making music. <b>The pictures...capture the essence of a lost, romantic moment in New York history</b>.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>New York Times T Magazine</i><br><br>"[One of the] best books of the year" &#x2013;<i>American Photo<br></i><br> &#x201c;...<i>Chris Stein/Negative: Me, Blondie, and the Advent of Punk</i>, an art book being published to coincide with the band&#x2019;s 40th anniversary. The book contains scores of photos, many of them never before published, of Blondie, the Ramones, the Talking Heads and other pioneers of the 1970s New York City rock scene. That aesthetic comes through in Stein&#x2019;s unfussy, mostly black-and-white images, which capture Harry, David Bowie, Joan Jett and other musicians in <b>spontaneous, revealing moments</b>.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>CNN</i><br><br> &#x201c;In 1974, New York City was the home to a potent burgeoning punk and new wave scene. Blondie&#x2019;s Chris Stein was there for all of it: his guitar in one hand, his camera in the other. As Blondie celebrates its 40th anniversary, Stein is releasing his first book of photographs, <i>Chris Stein/Negative: Me, Blondie, and the Advent of Punk</i>, which documents his life on stage, on the road and at home, including portraits of his friends who made the downtown scene: Iggy Pop, David Bowie, Andy Warhol, Joan Jett, Jean Michael Basquiat and many more.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Time Magazine</i><br><br> &#x201c;To commemorate the 40th anniversary of Blondie, Chris Stein is releasing his<b> treasure trove </b>of his photographs from the New York City music scene of the 1970s and early 1980s in his new book, <i>Chris Stein/Negative: Me, Blondie, and the Advent of Pun</i>k.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Smithsonian </i><br><br> &#x201c;Hearken back to the era of punk and new wave music with these snapshots. Chris Stein was at the center of the burgeoning punk/new wave scene in 1970s New York City as the lead guitarist for Blondie. Cutting edge bands such as Talking Heads, the Ramones and Television were establishing their sound at clubs like the now-defunct CBGB. And as a member of one of the leading groups on the scene and a recent photography graduate of New York&#x2019;s School of Visual Arts, Stein was uniquely positioned to document the musical pioneers of that time and place.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>Hollywood Reporter</i><br><br> &#x201c;...Chris Stein, has released a new photography book remembering its glory days. Though Stein claims to have thousands of photographs in his archives, the way he describes his photographic process is surprisingly casual. <i>Chris Stein / Negative: Me, Blondie, and the Advent of Punk,</i> chronicles the early punk scene, featuring not only rare photos of Debbie Harry, but also Joan Jett, Iggy Pop, the Ramones, and Andy Warhol.&#x201d; &#x2013;<i>New York Magazine</i><br><br>&#x201c;Blondie&nbsp;guitarist and songwriter Chris Stein released the almost self-titled&nbsp;<i>Chris Stein / Negative</i>, a handsome photobook featuring shots that begin in the mid-Seventies and end with a picture of&nbsp;Debbie Harry&nbsp;and Philip Glass taken at&nbsp;Lou Reed's memorial service.&#x201d;<i> &#x2013;Rolling Stone Magazine</i><br><br>"Less than a month after the release of <i>Chris Stein/Negative: Me, Blondie, and the Advent of Punk</i>, the coffee table debut from Blondie's co-founding member went on backorder. In case there was any doubt, that's how beloved they still are&#x2014;40 years into their career." &#x2013;<i>Vice</i><br><br><i>"Chris Stein/Negative: Me, Blondie, and the Advent of Punk,</i>&nbsp;culls from Stein&#x2019;s private collection going back to the early 1970s, with cameos by the Ramones, Joan Jett, Iggy Pop, and William S. Burroughs, among others. Harry, though, lures you in, every inch the glamorous rock star but also at ease in candid settings. "<i>&nbsp;-Boston Globe</i><br><br>"I&#x2019;m loving the new book of largely never-before-seen Blondie photographs from Chris Stein, out now from Rizzoli. So. Cool. " &#x2013;<i>The Fashion Spot</i>&nbsp;<br><br>"On the occasion of the band&#x2019;s 40th anniversary year, <i>Chris Stein/Negative: Me, Blondie, and the Advent of Punk </i>offers a revealing look back at one of the most trailblazing and influential bands of our time and the punk scene that they pioneered. From Blondie&#x2019;s early days, to their world travels and sold-out shows, to their legendary musical counterparts, it is all shown from the inside view of Chris Stein."&nbsp;-<i>Life and Times</i><br><br>"Along with the iconic Debbie Harry, Chris Stein is the driving force behind the influential &#x2019;70s punk/New Wave group Blondie. In addition to his talents as a guitarist and songwriter for the group, Stein is an accomplished photographer, as demonstrated in this new book. It not only features photos of Blondie throughout the &#x2019;70s to mid-80s, but also captures the mood and feel of New York City in throes of the punk rock scene defined by landmarks such as CBGB and the Mudd Club. The book also includes photos Stein took of city scene-sters like Basiquat, Richard Hell and Stephen Sprouse as well as fellow bands such as the Ramones, the New York Dolls, and Siouxie and the Banshees." <i>-Brooklyn Based</i><br><br>&#x201c;With this anniversary, Chris Stein, guitarist for the band, has released his book, showcasing a grungier New York and documenting Blondie&#x2019;s road to success. While Debbie Harry, singer for Blondie and Stein&#x2019;s former girlfriend, remains the star of this book, Stein also captured some of the most influential punkers and rockers to come out of NYC&#x2019;s music underground. Every picture tells a story, and along with his snaps, Stein has plenty of stories.&#x201d; <i>&#x2013;NewYork.com<br></i></p><h2>Betty Crocker The Big Book of Breakfast and Brunch (Betty Crocker Big Book)</h2><p>Tired of the breakfast blues?

However it is not so much a narrative of exotic foreign murder as one person&#x2019;s account of what it is like to live in the 20th century, possessing enough access to information and power to feel guilty about global human oppression, but not enough to deal with it. The usual result is a kind of daily schizophrenia by which we desensitize ourselves to our own responses to what we read in the newspapers.

Eve Arnold (1912&#x2013;2012) was born to a poor immigrant family in Philadelphia and became a photographer by chance. In 1950 Arnold was a 38-year-old Long Island housewife when she enrolled in a six-week photography course that led to her groundbreaking photo essay on black fashion models in Harlem. She went on to become the first woman to join Magnum Photos and, eventually, one of the most accomplished photojournalists of her time. Filled with reproductions of Arnold&#x2019;s acclaimed photographs, shot in both color and black and white, as well as previously unseen archival images, this biography relates Arnold&#x2019;s bold images to the fascinating story of their making. Renowned for her intimate portraits of figures such as Marilyn Monroe, Malcolm X, and Queen Elizabeth, Arnold was equally comfortable documenting the lives of the poor and dispossessed. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t see anybody as either ordinary or extraordinary. I see them simply as people in front of my lens.&#x201d; To her images of migrant workers, disabled veterans, and protesters for civil rights in the US and against apartheid in South Africa, she brought an unflinching eye and a strong sense of social justice. This highly engrossing narrative tells a compelling story of an intrepid artist whose life&#x2019;s purpose was to report on the lives of others.</p><p>Janine di Giovanni is the Middle East editor of <i>Newsweek</i> and a contributing editor to <i>Vanity Fair</i>.

It is the moment when the universe suffers a crisis of conscience. Should it expand or make a great big bang? It decides to wind the clock back a decade to 1991, making everyone in the world endure ten years of deja-vu and a total loss of free will - not to mention the torture of reliving every nanosecond of one of the tawdiest and most hollow decades. With his trademark wicked wit, Vonnegut addresses memory, suicide, the Great Depression, the loss of American eloquence, and the obsolescent thrill of reading books.</p><p>Think of <i>Timequake</i>, Kurt Vonnegut's 19th and last novel (or so he says), as a victory lap. It's a confident final trot 'round the track by one of the greats of postwar American literature. After 40 years of practice, Vonnegut's got his schtick down cold, and it's a pleasure--if a slightly tame one--to watch him go through his paces one more time. <p> <i>Timequake</i>'s a mongrel; it is half novel, half memoir, the project of a decade's worth of writer's block, a book "that didn't want to be written." The premise is standard-issue Vonnegut: "...a timequake, a sudden glitch in the space-time continuum, made everybody and everything do exactly what they'd done during past decades, for good or ill, a second time..." Simultaneously, the author's favorite tricks are on display--frequent visits with the shopworn science fiction writer Kilgore Trout, a Hitchcockian appearance by the author at the book's end, and frequent authorial opining on love, war, and society.</p>Kurt Vonnegut was born in Indianapolis in 1922 and studied biochemistry at Cornell University. During the Second World War he served in Europe and, as a prisoner of was in Germany, witnessed the destruction of Dresden by Allied bombers, an experience which inspired his classic novel Slaughterhouse-Five. He is the author of thirteen other novels, three collections of stories and five non-fiction books.

Over forty Inuit, Iupiat, and Inughuit from three different Arctic communities contributed stories, original artwork, hand-drawn illustrations, maps, family photos, and even recipes to this book.

As I read it, what came to mind was that the best way to describe the volume&#39;s qualities is that it is nothing less than a work of Ethno-Anthropology, an odd but right term to use here. The Inuit who participated in Siku-Inuit-Hila, in concert with the project&#39;s editors and scientific advisors, have produced a work that removes its subject from the realm of abstraction and in so doing makes it absolutely clear that the sea ice is not someplace Inuit only venture onto; rather it is an essential aspect of Inuit culture and life. The Meaning of Ice is very much greater than the sum of its parts and kudos to all involved in it.&#34;-- &#34;Arctic&#34;</p><h2>Fieldnotes: The Makings of Anthropology</h2><p><p>Thirteen distinguished anthropologists describe how they create and use the unique forms of writing they produce in the field.

Climate instability. Food insecurity. The endangered family farm. Water pollution and scarcity. Mass extinction. Converting agricultural land into more secure, climate-stabilizing, water-filtering, wildlife-harboring farms would be positively transformative. Luckily, there <em>is</em> a way, currently under development, to do just this in many temperate climates: hybrid hazelnuts.<br> <br> <em>Growing Hybrid Hazelnuts</em> is the first comprehensive guide for farmers interested in how to get started growing hybrid hazelnuts, a crop designed from the very outset to address a host of problems with conventional modern agriculture. Once hybrid hazelnuts are established, no plowing, or even cultivation, is necessary. Dramatically improved infiltration rates prevent water from running off of fields, regardless of soil type. The crop&#x2019;s extensive, permanent root systems&#x2015;at work 365 days a year&#x2015;mean that tilling should not be necessary in moderately wet soils, and that no fertilizer can escape into groundwater. No soil is lost to wind or rain; in fact, this crop builds soil, and wildlife finds cover and food in hazelnuts all year. Economically speaking, hazelnuts have a large, existing, and unsatisfied world market, not to mention their processing potential is even greater than soybeans.

If the authors of this distinctive horticultural guide have their way, however, hazelnuts will also be bred to resist the ravages of climate change and outstrip soybeans as a high demand, optimally sustainable crop worldwide. Developed and grown at the Badgersett Research Farm in Minnesota, where Rutter is the CEO, the hybrid plants recommended here are compact, densely yielding shrubs that require little cultivation, efficiently soak up water, and actually reverse soil erosion. Amazingly versatile, the hazelnut and its coproducts, including husks and shells, can be used not only for food but also for fuel and construction. Along with abundant photographs and useful charts, Rutter and his coauthors provide a wealth of information on growing-site requirements and management of a productive plantation, along with invaluable marketing tips. Their guide is a godsend for agricultural entrepreneurs and farmers desperate for newer, financially lucrative crops to replace those that have been, or may soon be, compromised by climate change.&#x201d;</p><br><br><p>"Anyone ready to innovate outside the box will be blown away by the vision and practical insights demonstrated in Growing Hybrid Hazelnuts.

Clare Hemmings examines the narratives that make up feminist accounts of recent feminist history, highlights the ethical and political dilemmas raised by these narratives, and offers innovative strategies for transforming them. Drawing on her in-depth analysis of feminist journals, such as <i>Signs</i>, <i>Feminist Review</i>, and <i>Feminist Theory</i>, Hemmings argues that feminists portray the development of Western feminism through narratives of progress, loss, and return. Whether celebrating the move beyond unity or identity, lamenting the demise of a feminist political agenda, or proposing a return to a feminist vision from the past, by advancing these narratives feminists construct a mobile &#x201c;political grammar&#x201d; too easily adapted for postfeminist agendas. Hemmings insists that it is not enough for feminist theorists to lament what is most often perceived as the co-optation of feminism in global arenas. They must pay attention to the amenability of their own stories, narrative constructs, and grammatical forms to broader discursive uses of gender and feminism if history is not simply to repeat itself. Since citation practices and the mobilization of affect are central to how the narratives of progress, loss, and return persuade readers to suspend disbelief, they are also potential keys to telling the story of feminism&#x2019;s past, present, and future differently.</p><p><p>Clare Hemmings is Reader in Feminist Theory and Director of the Gender Institute at the London School of Economics. She is the author of <i>Bisexual Spaces: A Geography of Gender and Sexuality</i>, co-author of <i>Practising Interdisciplinarity in Gender Studies</i>, and a member of the <i>Feminist Review</i> Collective.</p>&#x201c;<i>Why Stories Matter</i> is an exciting and impressive book, one that cannot fail to have an impact on the feminist academic community. Clare Hemmings contributes to radical new understandings of feminist theory by brilliantly synthesizing the debates that currently animate the field, and then intervening in ways that force the rethinking of accepted wisdom.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Rosi Braidotti</b>, Director, Centre for the Humanities, Utrecht University<br><br>&#x201c;I read <i>Why Stories Matter</i> with pleasure; it manages to specify and scrutinize much of what I too find dissatisfying, exasperating, and even enraging about contemporary conversations in academic feminism.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Eva Cherniavsky</b>, author of<i> Incorporations: Race, Nation, and the Body Politics of Capital</i><br><br>&#x201c;Whatever happens to Anglo-European feminist theory and politics in the future, the way we look at its past will never be the same again. This extraordinary book identifies the revolutionary elements of a truly global feminist sensibility so urgently required in the present: accountability, reflexivity, and an ability to grasp the intersections between different forms of inequality and power.&#x201d;&#x2014;<b>Vron Ware</b>, co-author of <i>Out of Whiteness: Color, Politics, and Culture</i><br><br>&#x201c;<i>Why Stories Matter</i> animates the field of feminist intellectual historiography. Hemmings provides a comprehensive and incisive approach that describes, critiques, and transforms the stories feminist scholars tell about their past. . . . Hemmings reminds us why our stories about the past of feminist scholarship have political and ethical prescience and, thus, why they matter.&#x201d; (Kelly Coogan-Gehr <i>Signs</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Clare Hemmings&#x2019;s <i>Why Stories Matter </i>is poised to prompt a major rethinking of feminist theory, and more importantly, of how we construct our histories of this field &#x2013; and what this says about feminists&#x2019; intellectual investments and our futures. This is an engagingly written and highly original close reading of theoretical debates in the pages of top feminist journals. . . . The result is&nbsp;a stimulating book, one that has the power to interrogate the reader&#x2019;s theoretical commitments, the stories she tells herself about her field, and the stories she tells others, including, if she teaches, her students.&#x201d; (Ilya Parkins <i>Reviews in Cultural Theory</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Hemmings&#x2019; interventions do more than constitute a meta-critique of Western&nbsp;feminism; they historicize and provincialize Western feminism with implications on how gender, sexuality and feminism are understood and taken up in a variety of trans/national contexts. This book is compulsory reading for anyone interested in feminism today; not just in Anglo-American feminism or in feminist theory, however, demarcated.&#x201d; (Srila Roy <i>Feminist Review</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Hemmings&#x2019;s book is an extraordinary encapsulation of major trends in recent feminist thought and is sweeping without being glossing, specific without getting mired in detail. Her contributions include not only exposing metanarratives that drive political investments without our noticing but also suggesting that feminists can gain more control over how feminism circulates by attending to this politicoemotional grammar.&#x201d; (Naomi Greyser <i>Feminist Studies</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;This excellent, original book identifies and critiques the stories feminists tell about feminism. . . . Hemmings&#x2019;s practice of detaching scholars&#x2019; names from their writing is inspired, because it moves away from praising or vilifying individual authors in favor of looking at prevailing narrative patterns. . . . Highly recommended. All readers.&#x201d; (R. R. Warhol <i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;... Hemmings is convincing in her mapping and unpacking of the recurring narratives, and argues persuasively that feminist scholars must take their roles as storytellers seriously... Hemming&#x2019;s passionate and erudite book should be embraced....&#x201d; (Fiona Philip <i>Parallax</i>)<br><br>"Hemmings&#x2019;s feminist narratives ... point to the potential of a feminist political grammar genuinely capable of promoting the kind of global social change so urgently needed."

Why do some birds have plumage that is intensely colored is it pigment, light, gender, robust health, or some combination of all four?

I loved it so much when I first read it, and had so much trouble finding subsequent volumes. I'm glad a new generation has a whack at it."--Delia Sherman, author of <i>The Porcelain Dove</i></p><h2>Teresa of Avila: The Progress of a Soul</h2><p>A refreshingly modern reconsideration of Saint Teresa (1515-1582), one of the greatest mystics and reformers to emerge within the sixteenth-century Catholic Church, whose writings are a keystone of modern mystical thought.<br><br>From the very beginning of her life in a convent, following the death of her mother and the marriage of her older sister, it was clear that Teresa's expansive nature, intensity, and energy would not be easily confined. Cathleen Medwick shows us a powerful daughter of the Church and her times who was a very human mass of contradictions: a practical and no-nonsense manager, and yet a flamboyant and intrepid presence who bent the rules of monastic life to accomplish her work--while managing to stay one step ahead of the Inquisition. And she exhibited a very personal brand of spirituality, often experiencing raptures of an unorthodox, arguably erotic, nature that left her frozen in one position for hours, unable to speak. Out of a concern for her soul and her reputation, her superiors insisted that she account for every voice and vision, as well as the sins that might have engendered them, thus giving us the account of her life that is now considered a literary masterpiece. <br><br>Medwick makes it clear that Teresa considered her major work the reform of the Carmelites, an enterprise requiring all her considerable persuasiveness and her talent for administration. We see her moving about Spain with the assurance (if not the authority) of a man, in spite of debilitating illness, to establish communities of nuns who lived scrupulously devout lives, without luxuries. In an era when women were seldom taken seriously, she even sought and received permission to found two religious houses for men.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<br><br>In this fascinating account Cathleen Medwick reveals Teresa as both more complex and more comprehensible than she has seemed in the past. She illuminates for us the devout and worldly woman behind the centuries-old iconography of the saint.</p><p>Saint Teresa (1515-1582) is widely considered one of the greatest mystics and woman reformers of the Renaissance. Author Cathleen Medwick (a former editor at <i>Vanity Fair</i> and <i>Mirabella</i>) clearly invested an enormous amount of research into this impressive biography of a brazen and complicated woman. Although she broke many of the social rules for nuns and even women of her day (for instance, she slept under the stars, traveled at whim, and spoke her mind freely), it was her ecstatic raptures that made her so controversial. "Sometimes she dropped to the floor and was frozen in position for hours, unable to speak," writes Medwick. "At other times she conversed with God directly, a dangerous practice, the Inquisition often having its ear to the door." Readers will find a fascinating character in this fully flawed and charismatic Spanish saint. More delightfully, readers will appreciate Medwick's strong narration and sense of story that sustains us through Teresa's trials and tribulations--and expertly leads us to her final rapture. <i>--Gail Hudson</i>Cathleen Medwick, an inveterate New Yorker,&nbsp;&nbsp;lives on a small farm in northern Westchester County.

Both are the American-born children of Iraqi immigrants, who grew up on opposite ends of California. Hadi considers Huda his childhood sweetheart, the first and only girl he&#39;s ever loved, but Huda needs proof that she is more than just the girl Hadi&#39;s mother has chosen for her son. She wants what many other American girls have--the entertainment culture&#39;s almost singular tale of chance meetings, defying the odds, and falling in love. She wants stolen kisses, romantic dates, and a surprise proposal. As long as she has a grand love story, Huda believes no one will question if her marriage has been arranged. But when Huda and Hadi&#39;s conservative Muslim families forbid them to go out alone before their wedding, Huda must navigate her way through the despair of unmet expectations and dashed happily-ever-after ideals. Eventually she comes to understand the toll of straddling two cultures in a marriage and the importance of reconciling what you dreamed of with the life you eventually live. Tender, honest and irresistibly compelling, First Comes Marriage is the first Muslim-American memoir dedicated to the themes of love and sexuality. Huda and Hadi&#39;s story brilliantly circles around a series of firsts, chronicling two virgins moving through their first everything: first hand holding, first kiss, and first sexual encounter. First Comes Marriage is an almost unbearably humanizing tale that tucks into our hearts and lingers in our imagination, while also challenging long-standing taboos within the Muslim community and the romantic stereotypes we unknowingly carry within us that sabotage some of our best chances for finding true love.</p><p><b>Huda Al-Marashi </b>currently lives in Encinitas, California, with her husband and three children. Her writing has appeared in the <i>Washington Post, </i>the<i> LA Times, Al Jazeera,</i> the<i> VIDA Review</i>, the <i>Offing</i>, and elsewhere.Chapter 1 - Husband Potential<br><br>I cannot remember a time when I didn&#x2019;t think of Hadi Ridha as a potential husband. The day my family first met the Ridhas, Mrs.&nbsp;Ridha took one look at me&#x2014;six years old and my hair in braids&#x2014;and my baby sister, Lina, and said, &#x201c;<i>Mashallah, mashallah</i>. We don&#x2019;t need to look anymore. We found our pretty girls.&#x201d;<br><br>At the time, I didn&#x2019;t know that my father and Dr. Ridha had gone to the same medical school in Baghdad. I didn&#x2019;t know that they&#x2019;d found each other at an American Academy of Neurology meeting in San Diego and that Dr. Ridha had invited us to his home for dinner. I didn&#x2019;t know that the Ridhas were also Iraqi and Shia, because those were descriptors I still didn&#x2019;t know to apply to myself.<br><br>All I knew that day was that the Ridhas were different in the same way we were different. They spoke Arabic with &#x201c;ch&#x201d; sounds, replacing the &#x201c;k&#x201d; sounds; they ate rice with stews called marga; and they kept their five daily prayers, even though Mrs. Ridha, like Mama, did not cover her hair with the hijab. These were my signs that of the two types of boys in the world&#x2014;those who were pos-sible to marry and those who were impossible&#x2014;the Ridha boys belonged to the former, the small population of boys from which I&#x2019;d be allowed to choose a husband.<br><br>It was a remarkable discovery for the early 1980s. The only Arab community in our small, seaside Northern California town was a secular social group filled with a mix of Lebanese, Palestinians,&nbsp;Syrians, and a few Iraqis who had immigrated so long ago they spoke more English than Arabic. No one in my parents&#x2019; small band of friends was quite like the Ridhas, whose dialect was still so fresh on their tongues, who knew so many other Iraqi immigrant families in the United States, and who matched our family not only in religion and level of devotion but also in ages and interests. The fathers got along. The mothers got along. The Ridha boys played well with my brother, Ibrahim, and Lina and I played well with their daughter, Jamila.<br><br>In spite of the four-hundred-mile distance between our Northern and Southern California homes, our families clung to each other. When the Ridhas came to our house, we took day trips to Carmel Beach, Big Sur, and San Francisco. We came back dirty and tired, and waited in line for a turn in one of the two bathrooms in our small ranch home. When my family stayed with the Ridhas, they drove us to Los Angeles County, to their newly founded Islamic center or masjid, and to events with the other Iraqi families gradually moving into the area.<br><br>By the time my little sister, Lina, was four years old, she&#x2019;d already intuited that the Ridha boys were the marriageable kind. After a picnic one sunny afternoon in Big Sur, she turned to Jamila Ridha, the oldest child among us, and said, &#x201c;I&#x2019;m full. Now can I have my wedding?&#x201d;<br><br>Lina had been gripped by wedding fever ever since she&#x2019;d fallen asleep and missed her chance to be a flower girl in Jamila&#x2019;s aunt&#x2019;s wedding. Jamila had promised Lina she could have a pretend wedding just as soon as everyone was done eating. At home, we&#x2019;d baked Lina a cake, using a box mix, while she put on her favorite summer dress, the one with the ruffles and the hula-dancer print, and then she stuck a comb with a short tulle veil in her mess of curly blond hair.<br><br>Now Jamila brushed the potato-chip salt off her fingers, reached out for Lina&#x2019;s hand, and guided her off the bench of the picnic table.&nbsp;Together we walked down the poison-oak-lined trail to the creek where our brothers were building a dam. Jamila climbed to the top of a flat rock, cupped her mouth, and called out, &#x201c;Guys, come here.&#x201d;<br><br>I listened to her voice bellow and admired the ease with which she commanded our brothers. Jamila was thirteen years old, four years older than me, and I believed in her authority. The boys, however, were unimpressed. The three of them continued slapping down the rocks they&#x2019;d chosen for their creek dam with a clank and a splash.<br><br>&#x201c;Guys,&#x201d; Jamila repeated. &#x201c;We promised.&#x201d;<br><br>My older brother, Ibrahim, waded out of the water, looking peeved. He hated it when Jamila tried to organize us.<br><br>Down from the rock, Jamila said, &#x201c;Ibrahim, you&#x2019;ll do the ceremony.&#x201d;<br><br>Ibrahim shook his head. His eyes were green and his eyelashes so thick and bold that the girls at school teased that he wore mascara. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll do it for Lina,&#x201d; he said. &#x201c;Not because you asked me to.&#x201d;<br><br>&#x201c;Well,&#x201d; Jamila said, turning to her two brothers who were approaching in their swim trunks, &#x201c;which one of you is going to be the groom?&#x201d;<br><br>Without a word, the Ridha boys stepped into their sandals, which were left at the side of a nearby rock, and moved in behind Ibrahim. The sun had deepened the tone of the brothers&#x2019; already dark skin. Amjad, the younger and shorter of the two, was wiry, pure flesh and bones, while Hadi was stockier with a small tummy and a waist that gave in on both sides to a slight crease.<br><br>I crouched down so that Lina and I were the same height and said, &#x201c;You don&#x2019;t need a boy to have a wedding. How about if you get married by yourself ?&#x201d;<br><br>Lina dropped her chin so low it almost touched her chest, and pushed her lips into a frown. &#x201c;But a bride has to have a husband,&#x201d; she said with such certainty it was clear that Lina already understood there were rules to getting married.<br><br>&#x201c;Just play along,&#x201d; Jamila said to Amjad, but he folded his arms and gave a firm no. She then turned to twelve-year-old Hadi. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll marry Lina, won&#x2019;t you? She&#x2019;s little. She doesn&#x2019;t understand what being married means. You don&#x2019;t want her to be disappointed, do you?&#x201d;<br><br>Hadi stood there with water dripping from his hair and listened to his sister&#x2019;s argument with his hands on his hips. He looked down and kicked the rock closest to his foot. He watched it scuttle across the ground.<br><br>&#x201c;Okay,&#x201d; he said.<br><br>Surely Hadi knew there would be teasing&#x2014;that our parents would laugh heartily at the memory of the little bride and her new husband for years to come&#x2014;and yet he was willing to put up with this for my sister&#x2019;s happiness.<br><br>From the front of the campground firepit, where I stood as Lina&#x2019;s maid of honor, I watched Lina walk down the dusty aisle between a run of benches, clutching a bunch of artificial flowers with one hand, the other hand trying to suppress a giggle. Our mothers looked on from a bench off to the side, squealing in pure delight at Lina&#x2019;s irrepressible joy, the fluff of golden hair peeking out from behind her veil. Mrs. Ridha called out to her sons, &#x201c;Pay attention, boys. One day you will dream to marry such pretty girls.&#x201d;<br><br>When Ibrahim opened his facetious wedding ceremony with, &#x201c;Dearly beloved with the exception of Jamila,&#x201d; my gaze fell on Hadi standing at Lina&#x2019;s side, playing along with a sincerity I&#x2019;d never seen in a boy. I took a snapshot of Hadi in my mind&#x2014;still in his swim trunks and as tanned as a piece of overdone toast. I decided if I did, indeed, marry Hadi one day, this would be the moment I&#x2019;d say I first fell in love with him.</p><h2>Code Breaker: The untold story of Richard Hayes, the Dublin librarian who helped turn the tide of WWII</h2><p><p>The incredible true story of the librarian, the Nazi spy and Ireland&#x2019;s secret role in turning the tide of World War II.</p><p>When unassuming librarian Richard Hayes, a gifted polymath and cryptographer, was drafted by Irish intelligence services to track the movements of a prolific Nazi spy, Hermann G�rtz, Dublin became the unlikely venue for one of the most thrilling episodes in Irish history.</p><p>In a complex game of cat-and-mouse that would wind its way through the city and its suburbs, <i>Code Breaker</i> reveals how Richard Hayes cracked a code that helped turn the tide of World War II, and uncovers a secret history of the capital that has remained hidden in plain view for the past 70 years.</p></p><p></p><h2>Dante: The Story of His Life</h2><p><p>Marco Santagata&#x2019;s <i>Dante: The Story of His Life</i> illuminates one of the world&#x2019;s supreme poets from many angles&#x2015;writer, philosopher, father, courtier, political partisan. Santagata brings together a vast body of Italian scholarship on Dante&#x2019;s medieval world, untangles a complex web of family and political relationships for English readers, and shows how the composition of the <i>Commedia</i> was influenced by local and regional politics.</p><p>Santagata traces Dante&#x2019;s attempts to establish himself in Florentine society as a man of both letters and action. He raises the intriguing possibility that Dante translated an illness, thought by some to be epilepsy, into an intensely physical phenomenology of love in the <i>Vita Nova</i>. Most importantly, Santagata highlights Dante&#x2019;s constant need to readjust his political stance&#x2015;his involvement with the pro-Papacy Guelph faction as well as his network of patrons&#x2015;in response to unfolding events. Linking these shifts to the changing ethical and political convictions expressed in the <i>Commedia</i>, Santagata reveals the paradoxical achievement of Dante&#x2019;s masterpiece: a unified, universal poem nonetheless intimately entwined with the day-to-day dealings of its author.</p><p>The most striking facet of Dante&#x2019;s personality was a belief in his unique destiny. In every aspect of his life&#x2015;his birth under the sign of Gemini, falling in love with Beatrice, banishment from Florence&#x2015;Dante glimpsed the shadow of his fate. This idea, cultivated by the poet in his youth, grew into the conviction that God had invested him with the prophetic mission of saving humanity.</p></p><p>Marco Santagata is Professor of Italian Literature at the University of Pisa.Definitely recommended, it will make my best non-fiction of the year list for sure. (Tyler Cowen <i>Marginal Revolution</i>)<br><br>To the ranks of the best popular biographies of the great Florentine poet Dante Alighieri...is added Marco Santagata&#x2019;s <i>Dante</i>... [Santagata] tells it with a fiercely learned calm and energy throughout... As with all first-rate author biographies, the book will propel readers straight back to Dante&#x2019;s own works, which is right where they should end up in any case. (Steve Donoghue <i>Open Letters Monthly</i>)<br><br>Full of useful information and explanations of a very complicated time, well worth reading for its bold claims and wealth of historical evidence, this book constructs a novel, strong reading of Dante as political actor.

A welcome addition to the catalogue of intellectual biographies of Dante available in English. (Simone Marchesi, Princeton University)<br><br>A superb intellectual biography of Dante. (Ian Thomson <i>The Tablet</i>)<br><br>This sumptuous volume by Marco Santagata...offers the reader a richly documented and often gripping account of the development, peregrinations, and shifting fortunes of the celebrated poet Durante (Dante) Alighieri. (Diana Glenn <i>Australian Book Review</i>)<br><br>Santagata does a thorough and highly engaging job of bringing politics and social pressures of 13th-century Florence to the page in this very readable biography that doesn&#x2019;t scrimp on scholarly research...Even more fascinating is the way the author reveals Dante&#x2019;s intense interest in political systems, philosophy, and in the makeup of the universe, all shown to be at the very heart of the imposing poetic figure. (Herman Sutter <i>Library Journal (starred review)</i>)<br><br>Santagata has written a book that any reader interested in Dante will find absorbing, richly informative and very thought-provoking...With their well-known fondness for literary biography, [English readers] will surely be grateful for this bold, vigorous and invigorating account of Dante&#x2019;s life and times. (Prue Shaw <i>Times Higher Education</i>)<br><br>It is lively and a pleasure to read. (Simon West <i>The Australian</i>)<br><br>This substantial work incorporates all the most recent Dantean scholarship. There is much to chew upon, since Dante lived at the very center of his city&#x2019;s political life...Santagata, thoroughly steeped in the politics and genealogies of the period, gives the best account I have ever read of Dante in his historical context...You will never read an account clearer than Santagata&#x2019;s. Nor will you read a more convincing description of how Dante changed his mind, quite fundamentally, about the political issues which confronted him (Pope <i>vs</i> Emperor) and the deep religious questions which underpin his work...This is a wonderful book. Even if you have not read Dante you will be gripped by its account of one of the most extraordinary figures in the history of literature, and one of the most dramatic periods of European history. If you are a Dantean, it will be your invaluable companion forever. (A. N.

I will nae do it!&#x201d;<br> <br>Lachlan Hamilton, the Duke of Hamilton and Conner&#x2019;s brother-in-law, stared out the castle window at the rocky cliff overhanging the cold, gray sea. &#x201c;?&#x2019;Tis nae a question,&#x201d; he said shortly.<br> <br>Conner knew what lay on that cliff. Under a giant oak was a grave, the dirt freshly turned from the burial they&#x2019;d attended not an hour ago.<br> <br>Och, Anna, why did you leave us? A wave of grief hit Conner like a hammer and he had to swallow twice before he could even breathe. His only sister, gone. &#x201c;Hamilton, &#x2019;tis too soon. You cannae expect us to&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I do and I will,&#x201d; Hamilton snapped with a look of blazing fury. &#x201c;You and your brothers will find wives within the next three months or you&#x2019;ll nae touch a penny of your inheritances.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;You&#x2019;ve nae that authority.&#x201d; Jack&#x2019;s voice was heavy with rage.<br> <br>Conner eyed his oldest brother with unease. Jack was not called &#x201c;the Black Douglas&#x201d; for naught; his temper was as dark as his midnight hair.<br> <br>&#x201c;I am the executor of your sister&#x2019;s will,&#x201d; the duke said grimly. &#x201c;Do as Anna wished and find wives, and I&#x2019;ll grant you each your portion of the inheritance. Guid wives, too&#x2014;nae tavern maids, nae actresses, and nae soiled doves, but women of quality like your sister.&#x201d;<br> <br>Conner ground his teeth in anger, not just at the terms of the will, but at life. One week ago he, Declan, and Jack had sailed here, to the Isle of Arran, in high spirits after receiving word that their sister Anna was delivering her baby. They&#x2019;d expected to be met at the dock by their brother-in-law, jubilant with news of a bonnie lad or lassie. Instead the butler awaited, his pale face and trembling mouth delivering his wretched news for him.<br> <br>Conner curled his hands into fists and pressed them into his thighs to stop the pain. Anna, who had raised all three of them when their parents had died eighteen years ago in a carriage accident, was gone.<br> <br>God, Anna, what am I&#x2014;we&#x2014;to do without you? His eyes burned and he swiped at them with an impatient hand. He and his brothers had been blessed with a strong, capable sibling who had become more mother than sister. And even though he&#x2019;d been on his own for years, without her, he was as lost as a ship without a rudder.<br> <br>Declan scowled at Hamilton. &#x201c;Three months to find a wife? &#x2019;Tis nae long enough.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Then make it four months, but nae a day more. And dinnae argue, for I&#x2019;m being generous in giving you that.&#x201d; The duke turned from the window and planted his feet, facing his three brothers-in-law. &#x201c;So go. The lot of you. And dinnae come back until you&#x2019;ve properly wed.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nae,&#x201d; Jack snapped. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re trying to force us to bend to your wishes, nae Anna&#x2019;s.&#x201d;<br> <br>The look Hamilton gave Jack was as bleak as night. &#x201c;You think I give a damn aboot any of you? If I had my way, I&#x2019;d give you your blasted portions and send you off so you&#x2019;d bother me nae more. But Anna wanted you settled and thought this would serve.&#x201d; He glowered at them all. &#x201c;Do as your sister asked, or the family fortune will be distributed to others.&#x201d;<br> <br>Conner picked up his glass of whisky. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ve never wished for the damned money, anyway. Keep it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack&#x2019;s dark look disappeared at Conner&#x2019;s words. &#x201c;We&#x2019;ve made our own way withoot it. Why would we wish for it now?&#x201d;<br> <br>Hamilton&#x2019;s brows climbed, and he said in a suddenly silky tone, &#x201c;Indeed? You&#x2019;d have the Douglas fortune gifted to the Campbells, then?&#x201d;<br> <br>Conner choked on his whisky. &#x201c;The Campbells? They&#x2019;re our greatest enemies!&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Are you daft?&#x201d; Declan demanded.<br> <br>Hamilton fixed a frosty gaze on them. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m doing as Anna asked, unpleasant as &#x2019;tis. She was tired of your spendthrift ways&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We pay our own way, and always have,&#x201d; Conner protested.<br> <br>&#x201c;Aye, through pirating and thievery and smuggling,&#x201d; the duke snapped, his jaw set. &#x201c;Nae to mention the gambling and whoremongering and scandals. Nae wonder Anna despaired of you.&#x201d;<br> <br>A twinge of guilt hit Conner. Anna had always worried; but wasn&#x2019;t that what sisters did?<br> <br>&#x201c;Come, Hamilton, dinnae be hasty,&#x201d; Declan said in a soothing tone. &#x201c;Anna&#x2019;s death is&#x2014;&#x201d; His voice broke, but he swallowed hard, and added in a husky voice, &#x201c;None of us are oop to facing life right now. Let&#x2019;s nae make any decisions whilst we&#x2019;re struggling to catch our breaths. Give us a few months to think aboot this, to find a way to answer her wishes.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;She said three months, and oot of respect for your grief, I&#x2019;ve added a month. But that is all I&#x2019;ll give you and it&#x2019;s bloody well all I&#x2019;ll say aboot it.&#x201d; Hamilton waved a hand. &#x201c;Go. And dinnae return until you&#x2019;ve done as Anna wished.&#x201d;<br> <br>Declan spread his hands. &#x201c;Hamilton, be reasonable. We just need&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Reasonable?&#x201d; Hamilton&#x2019;s voice was quiet, yet it thundered through the study. &#x201c;I just lost my wife, the only woman I ever loved, or will love, and I&#x2019;m left with a babe to raise on my own. Right now, the whole world is cold, cruel, and bloody unreasonable.&#x201d; His gaze flickered over all of them. &#x201c;Now go. Dinnae marry and I&#x2019;ll give your funds to the Campbells. I dinnae care who has it.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Hell will freeze before a Campbell touches Douglas gold!&#x201d; Furious, Jack started forward, but Declan grabbed his brother&#x2019;s arm and jerked him back.<br> <br>Hamilton&#x2019;s mouth had gone white. &#x201c;Dinnae test me. Today of all days, I&#x2019;d like nothing more than to stomp the life oot of someone. Fate owes me that satisfaction, if nae else.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack made as if to rise to the bait, but Declan said sharply, &#x201c;Whatever Anna wished for, it was nae an argument. She hated it when any of us disagreed.&#x201d;<br> <br>There was a moment of heavy silence, emotions too raw to ignore thickening the air. Somewhere in the distance a door slammed, followed by the faint cry of a baby.<br> <br>The duke turned toward the cry, all color draining from his face. His shoulders sank and he took an involuntary step back, as if struck by a sword&#x2019;s blow.<br> <br>As the baby&#x2019;s cry was hushed by the soothing voice of a nanny, the duke leaned heavily against the wall, his head down, his breathing harsh.<br> <br>As if the wind has left his sails. Conner cleared his throat. &#x201c;Perhaps we should go to the babe and&#x2014;&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Nae,&#x201d; Hamilton said harshly. &#x201c;He is with the wet nurse. She will care for him.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack&#x2019;s brows lowered. &#x201c;Hamilton, dinnae hold the lad at fault for Anna&#x2019;s death. He did naught but be born.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Of course I dinnae blame him,&#x201d; Hamilton snapped, his voice raw. &#x201c;If anyone is at fault for Anna&#x2019;s death, &#x2019;tis me.&#x201d;<br> <br>The words hung in the room.<br> <br>Conner shook his head. &#x201c;?&#x2019;Twas the cruelness of nature, Hamilton, but nae more.&#x201d;<br> <br>Hamilton slowly gathered himself and turned back to the window, his expression hidden from view. &#x201c;Leave. Now.&#x201d;<br> <br>Conner exchanged looks with Declan. What did it bode for Anna&#x2019;s babe if his father could not even bear to hear his cries?<br> <br>Jack&#x2019;s eyes were now dark with sadness instead of fury. Silently, he crossed the room to where the duke stood slumped against the wall. After an awkward moment, he placed his hand on Hamilton&#x2019;s broad shoulder.<br> <br>The duke bowed his head, but did not move. It wasn&#x2019;t an encouragement, but neither was it a rebuff.<br> <br>Declan cleared his throat and went to stir the fire, as if to give Jack and the duke a bit of time in silence. Conner looked out the door to the broad stone staircase that led to the nursery, his heart aching. Anna had wanted to have a child so badly. Now she&#x2019;d never have the chance to hold the baby in her arms, never know the pleasure of being a mother, never see her baby grow and laugh and&#x2014; The burn of tears threatened to escape his control. This will nae help anyone. But there is one thing that will.<br> <br>He dashed his hand over his eyes and sighed. &#x201c;Fine. I will do as Anna wished.&#x201d;<br> <br>Declan and Jack turned surprised faces his way.<br> <br>&#x201c;She was right and &#x2019;tis time. &#x2018;Marry, settle doon, be at peace with your life.&#x2019;?&#x201d; Conner managed a faint smile. &#x201c;How many times did she tell us that? A hundred?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;At least.&#x201d; Declan&#x2019;s smile carried regret, and after a quiet moment, he nodded. &#x201c;I will agree, too. I will find a wife, and soon.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack&#x2019;s face hardened, and he dropped his hand from the duke&#x2019;s shoulder, but didn&#x2019;t argue.<br> <br>The duke pushed himself from the wall and turned to face them. &#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We should nae tarry. Come.&#x201d; Conner went to the door, his brothers following. Once there, he turned to say good-bye, but Hamilton was already looking back out the window, his gaze locked on the grave.<br> <br>Declan jerked his head toward the hallway and the three of them left, softly closing the door behind them.<br> <br>Jack scowled as they headed to the front door. &#x201c;Much as I loved our sister, I&#x2019;d go into this more willingly if I knew there were benefits other than honoring her memory.&#x201d;<br> <br>Conner accepted his coat from a footman. &#x201c;If we marry and settle doon, it will silence society&#x2019;s chattering. &#x2019;Twas that which irritated Anna.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack glowered. &#x201c;All I want is to howl and stomp like a madman.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;As do I.&#x201d; Declan gave a humorless laugh. &#x201c;Perhaps we need wives to soften our angry hearts.&#x201d;<br> <br>Conner wondered what he would do with his inheritance. He&#x2019;d never thought about it before; he&#x2019;d been too busy with his shipping and privateering interests, which had proven wildly profitable. Truly, he had no need of these funds. But, then, neither do the bloody Campbells.<br> <br>The butler opened the door. Conner sent a final glance up the long stairway where his nephew was now sleeping. Should he visit the lad? He shook his head; he&#x2019;d just wake the babe. The lad was better left in the care of the nurse Anna had chosen before her lying in.<br> <br>With a reluctant sigh, Conner followed his brothers outside. They stood in the cold, the wet, gray day suiting their moods as they waited for the carriage.<br> <br>Conner turned up his collar against the wind. &#x201c;We might as well make the best of this. Think, lads: had we received our inheritances withoot the security offered by a marriage, we&#x2019;d be the targets of every matchmaking mama in Scotland.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack looked appalled. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re right.&#x201d;<br> <br>Declan grimaced. &#x201c;We would nae be able to go oot in public withoot being mobbed by crazed mamas and their wedding-hungry daughters.&#x201d;<br> <br>Jack nodded. &#x201c;By Zeus, that&#x2019;s true. We must find pleasant, malleable brides and quickly.&#x201d;<br> <br>Conner added, &#x201c;A lass with the guid sense nae to try and change us. Someone nae demanding. A woman of calm disposition, nae given to dramatic scenes or possessive tantrums, who&#x2014;&#x201d; Good God, he knew a woman like that. Only one, but one was enough. Thea.<br> <br>Theodora Cumberbatch-Snowe was the sister of one of his best friends. She was well born, practical, and pretty enough, although rather quiet. The daughter of a diplomat, she knew her way through life, plus she was well past society&#x2019;s declared marriageable age, which would make her grateful for his offer. Flooded with relief, he announced, &#x201c;I know the lady I&#x2019;ll marry. My friend Derrick&#x2019;s sister, Thea. I&#x2019;ll go to her and tell her what&#x2019;s toward with the will. She&#x2019;ll marry me and be glad of it.&#x201d;<br> <br>Declan shook his head. &#x201c;Conner, lad, you&#x2019;re a bloody fool if you think Miss Cumberbatch-Snowe will entertain such a slapdash suit. I&#x2019;ve met the lady, and she dinnae strike me as the type to accept a half-baked proposal.&#x201d;<br> <br>Conner grinned. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll wager you a hundred pounds she&#x2019;ll take my offer withoot question.&#x201d;<br> <br>Declan looked intrigued. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll tell her flat oot you&#x2019;re desirous of marrying her for nae other reason than to attain your inheritance?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;And that you think she&#x2019;d nae be a bother as a wife?&#x201d; Jack added.<br> <br>Conner scoffed, &#x201c;I&#x2019;d never lie to Thea. She knows me and accepts me as I am.&#x201d; She liked him well enough, he was certain of that. She always seemed pleased when he visited, and she couldn&#x2019;t wish to spend the rest of her days at her parents&#x2019; house. Who would?<br> <br>Jack snorted in amusement. &#x201c;Fool. I accept your offer of a hundred.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Count me in,&#x201d; Declan said. &#x201c;That&#x2019;s a hundred each, nae a hundred split between us.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Done. You two are making an error; I know her weel. I&#x2019;ve been friends with her and her family since I met her brother at Cambridge.&#x201d;<br> <br>Declan snorted. &#x201c;Friendship is one thing, wiving another.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;I&#x2019;ll enjoy spending your funds, both of you.&#x201d; He wouldn&#x2019;t enjoy being wed, but perhaps with Thea, marriage would at least be bearable. He was fortunate Thea&#x2019;s father was between assignments now, or Conner might have had to sail to a foreign clime to find his intended bride. As it was, she was safely docked at Cumberbatch House, a mere week&#x2019;s travel away, ready and waiting. As if it&#x2019;s meant to be. He grinned at his brothers. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see how right I am. In a month or so, I&#x2019;ll make my appearance at Cumberbatch House and walk away with the perfect wife.&#x201d;<br> <br>Declan&#x2019;s eyebrows rose. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re nae going straight there?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;We&#x2019;ve four months, so there&#x2019;s nae rush, and the lady&#x2019;s father is awaiting orders that are nae expected for two months or more, so she&#x2019;s going naewhere soon. I might as weel enjoy the time I have left as a single mon.&#x201d;<br> <br>Declan didn&#x2019;t look convinced. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re taking a lot for granted.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Never take a woman for granted,&#x201d; Jack added in a grim tone.<br> <br>Conner waved them off like pesky flies. &#x201c;You&#x2019;ll see. Meanwhile, what will you two fools do? Any likely candidates in mind?&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Bloody hell, nae.&#x201d; Jack raked a hand through his hair. &#x201c;I want a wife like I want a shot in the arse. I&#x2019;ve nae idea who I&#x2019;m to marry; I dinnae care overmuch for respectable women.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;They are boring,&#x201d; Declan agreed.<br> <br>The coach rattled around the castle and stopped before them, two portmanteaus strapped to the back. As the footman hurried from the castle to open the coach door, Declan frowned. &#x201c;Where&#x2019;s my black trunk?&#x201d;<br> <br>The footman blinked. &#x201c;I&#x2019;m sorry, sir, but these were the only bags in the foyer.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dammit. That fool valet must have forgotten to send it doon.&#x201d; He turned to his brothers. &#x201c;Go ahead. I&#x2019;ll meet you at the ship.&#x201d;<br> <br>&#x201c;Dinnae be late.&#x201d; Conner climbed into the carriage and took a seat, Jack joining him. &#x201c;With this wind, we cannae wait.&#x201d;<br> <br>Declan stepped back from the coach. &#x201c;If I&#x2019;m nae there when the tide turns, leave withoot me. I&#x2019;ll catch another ship in a day or two.&#x201d;<br> <br>Conner banged on the ceiling to signal to the coachman to head to the port, anxious to leave. These next few weeks would be his last days of freedom, and he was determined to wring every possible ounce of pleasure from them. But in the meantime, he could relax, for his path&#x2014;and Thea&#x2019;s, though she didn&#x2019;t yet know it&#x2014;was set.</p><h2>Insectopedia</h2><p><p><b>A <i>New York Times </i>Notable Book</b><br><br>A stunningly original exploration of the ties that bind us to the beautiful, ancient, astoundingly accomplished, largely unknown, and unfathomably different species with whom we share the world.<br>&nbsp;<br>For as long as humans have existed, insects have been our constant companions. Yet we hardly know them, not even the ones we&#x2019;re closest to: those that eat our food, share our beds, and live in our homes. Organizing his book alphabetically, Hugh Raffles weaves together brief vignettes, meditations, and extended essays, taking the reader on a mesmerizing exploration of history and science, anthropology and travel, economics, philosophy, and popular culture. <i>Insectopedia </i>shows us how insects have triggered our obsessions, stirred our passions, and beguiled our imaginations.</p></p><p><strong>Neil Shubin Reviews <em>Insectopedia</em></strong> <br> <br> <strong>Neil Shubin is provost of The Field Museum as well as professor of anatomy at the University of Chicago, where he also serves as an associate dean. Educated at Columbia, Harvard, and the University of California at Berkeley, he lives in Chicago and is the author of the national bestseller, <em>Your Inner Fish</em>. Read Shubin's guest review of <em>Insectopedia</em>:</strong> <br> <p> </p> <p><em>Insectopedia</em> is one of the most remarkable books I have read in a long time. Like its subject, it is many things, all of them fascinating. First, it is a reference book of the first order: it is loaded with facts--some profound, others curious, and still others laugh-out-loud funny. <em>Insectopedia</em> is also part personal memoir, scientific detective story, and even cultural study. We travel the Amazon, visit Chernobyl, and enter laboratories and sidewalk cafes in search of insects and the ideas and cultures they inspire. Insects stir eerie fascination: they are beautiful, disgusting, important, and annoying. To some they are tasty. To others they are a source of sexual fetish. Who knew? In Raffles's hands insects become windows into our culture, science, health--even our psyche. In each page of <em>Insectopedia</em>, the more we learn of insects, the more we come to face--and sometimes even challenge--our own views of the world.</p> <p>Hugh Raffles's work stands alone for what it says both about its subject and about us. After reading <em>Insectopedia</em>, it's hard to look at a cricket, a bumblebee, and a human being the same way ever again. I adored the book. What an accomplishment. And I thought I knew insects... <em>--Neil Shubin</em></p> <strong><br>A Q&amp;A with Hugh Raffles</strong> <br> <p> <strong>Question:</strong> You&#x2019;re an anthropologist who has written about life in the Brazilian Amazon in <em>In Amazonia: A Natural History</em>. Why insects for this book? Have you always been fascinated by insects and people&#x2019;s interactions with them?</p> <p><strong>Hugh Raffles:</strong> Actually, no! But since I started researching this book a few years ago, I&#x2019;ve become completely obsessed by insects and our relationships with them. Now they seem like the most amazing creatures. But before that, they were around me but weren&#x2019;t something I paid that much attention to unless they were biting me or invading my apartment.</p> <p>For a long time though, I&#x2019;ve been interested in the connections between people and animals of all types. And I&#x2019;ve thought a lot about what other worlds exist alongside the ones that we people live in. Most of these worlds are invisible to us. To give an example: we usually assume that time is a universal measure that everyone experiences in more or less similar ways. But it seems likely that other animals&#x2019; experience of time is completely different from ours--that for them, their short lives might actually last a very long time.</p> <p>Despite the complexity of our own reality, it&#x2019;s quite a limited universe when we consider all the parallel realities within which other beings exist. Insects are fascinating because they&#x2019;re so different from us. It&#x2019;s almost impossible to imagine what the worlds they live in are like. Recreating those worlds is one of the things I try to do in <em>The Illustrated Insectopedia</em>, often by meeting people (artists, musicians, and scientists, for example) who have their own interesting ways of thinking about this.</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> How did you decide on this encyclopedic format of A to Z? Did that seem a natural order after you wrote the essays or did you plan that from the beginning?</p> <p><strong>Hugh Raffles:</strong> I&#x2019;m one of those people who&#x2019;s interested in pretty much everything. After spending a long time writing a book about one small community in the Brazilian Amazon, I wanted a project that would give me the freedom to find out about as many things as possible. The form of an encyclopedia seemed perfect for that. Now, I also realize that the insects pushed me in this direction: there are so many of them and so many different species, they&#x2019;re everywhere and they won&#x2019;t stay still--the book needed a structure that would capture some of that energy.</p> <p>There were two other reasons for the A to Z. One was that, much as I like encyclopedias, I also wanted to make fun of them--the vanity of the idea that it&#x2019;s possible to know everything, and then possible to collect all that knowledge in one place. My entries are a little arbitrary, but then, so are the entries in a real encyclopedia when you compare them with all the possible information that could be included.</p> <p>The second reason was that I wanted to find out what it would be like to write with such a constraining form. It was tough! In fact, it was exhausting to be locked into 26 entries. There was a long period when I&#x2019;d already written enough chapters for a whole book but still wasn&#x2019;t even halfway through the alphabet. I&#x2019;d say there were a couple of years when I lost hope that I&#x2019;d ever get the thing finished. But on the other hand, there&#x2019;s no doubt that the alphabet pushed me to be more creative than I would have been otherwise--and it let me experiment with writing essays of different lengths and different styles. And it was fun--it encouraged me to be playful, which is always good!</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> How did you research topics in this book? What led you from one topic to the next?</p> <p><strong>Hugh Raffles:</strong> I started working on this book back in 2003 and since then I&#x2019;ve been constantly on the lookout for interesting stories and situations about insects. Lots of people sent me ideas and I built up a collection of possible topics. I wanted an "encyclopedic" spread of chapters--a wide range across history and geography. And, in fact, the book visits 11th century Japan, 16th century Prague, 19th century France, modern-day China, Niger, and Florence, among many other times and places.</p> <p>I was especially interested in situations in which people and insects encountered each other in such a way that the superiority of human beings was no longer certain. I looked for situations in which the meeting between people and insects led to the person discovering something new about themselves, about his or her relationship to other beings, and about what it means to be human. I&#x2019;d like to say that the insects had some kind of experience in these encounters too, but I don&#x2019;t think I&#x2019;ve managed to figure that out yet!</p> <p><strong>Question:</strong> What was the most bizarre thing you discovered about people and insects? How about the most universal thing?</p> <p><strong>Hugh Raffles:</strong> The most bizarre thing? Well, it&#x2019;s probably the most universal thing too. The more I&#x2019;ve learned about insects and the more amazing they&#x2019;ve become to me, the more strange it seems that we kill them without the least thought. Elias Canetti said that insects are "outlaws" because they are the only living beings which we kill with absolutely no moral qualms--think of Obama and the fly he swatted during that CNBC interview. What did he say? Something like "Got you, sucker!" That seems pretty bizarre to me and, unfortunately, more or less universal!</p> <p>(Photo � Michael Lionstar)</p><p>Hugh Raffles teaches anthropology at The New School.

But our familiarity with the letter can cause us to neglect or overlook Paul's message to the Philippians. Dr Matthew Harmon in this uplifting and inspiring work brings context and application to this wonderful book.<br>Matthew Harmons excellent commentrary on Philippians secured The Gospel Coalition Book of the Year 2015 (Bible and Theology Category) Find out more at: TGC Book of the Year 2015 </p></p><p>Dr Matthew Harmon serves as Professor of New Testament Studies at Grace College and Theological Seminary in Winona Lake, Indiana. He also serves on the preaching team of Christ&#39;s Covenant Church....deep-rooted, solid, and broadly accessible. This will now be my "go-to" book for teaching or preaching Philippians. I can't commend Matt Harmon's commentary on Philippians highly enough to pastors and students in all areas of church ministry and life. (Dan Phillips ~ Pastor, Copperfield Bible Church, author and blogger at Pyromaniacs, Houston, Texas)<br><br>...insightful theological analysis, and practical pastoral application. Pastors and laypeople alike can benefit from this finely crafted work. (Justin Taylor ~ Executive vice president, Crossway Books and blogger, "Between Two Worlds", Wheaton, Illinois)<br><br>... a model of good commentary writing...I commend his work to students, teachers, and preachers who seek better to understand this important letter of Paul. (Douglas Moo ~ Wessner Chair of Biblical Studies, Wheaton College, Wheaton, Illinois)<br><br>Matthew Harmon has given us a fresh and faithful reading of Philippians that will be a powerful help to all who preach and teach the Word. (James M. Hamilton Jr. ~ Professor of Biblical Theology, The Southern Baptist Theological Seminary, Louisville, Kentucky)<br><br>Matt Harmon explains Paul's letter clause by clause, traces Paul's argument, reads Paul's argument in light of the rest of the Bible, and applies the letter to people today. (Andy Naselli ~ Assistant Professor of New Testament and Biblical Theology, Bethlehem College and Seminary, Minneapolis, Minnesota)<br><br>... Harmon has struck an extremely helpful balance with this commentary on Philippians. While neither becoming lost in scholarly cul-de-sacs nor avoiding tough questions, Harmon focuses on the text of Paul's letter and its application. His commentary is a sensitive and thoughtful guide to Philippians that will be appreciated by pastors, scholars, students, and (perhaps especially) by those who are some combination of the three.<br><br>One particular strength of the commentary is Harmon's clear and thoughtful analysis of Paul's use of the OT in Philippians. Philippians has too often been neglected in studies of the use of the OT in the NT, but Harmon brings the sophistication and sensitivity that mark his previous work on the OT in Galatians to this commentary, while avoiding unnecessary technicality.<br><br>A solid, well-researched commentary that should stand among the primary commentaries on Philippians for many readers. (Journal of the Evangelical Theological Society)<br><br>Matthew Harmon's commentary on Philippians is an outstanding work. We find careful exegesis and a clear explanation of the text. The commentary is theologically rich, in terms of both biblical and systematic theology, and so there is more than a running commentary. Harmon also applies the text to readers in practical ways. Scholars, students, pastors, and teachers will profit significantly from this work. (Thomas R.

The SRP, a scientific and industrial complex near Aiken, South Carolina, grew out of a 1950 partnership between the Atomic Energy Commission and the DuPont Corporation and was dedicated to producing materials for the hydrogen bomb. Kari Frederickson shows how the needs of the expanding national security state, in combination with the corporate culture of DuPont, transformed the economy, landscape, social relations, and politics of this corner of the South. In 1950, the area comprising the SRP and its surrounding communities was primarily poor, uneducated, rural, and staunchly Democratic; by the mid-1960s, it boasted the most PhDs per capita in the state and had become increasingly middle class, suburban, and Republican.</p><p>The SRP's story is notably dramatic; however, Frederickson argues, it is far from unique. The influx of new money, new workers, and new business practices stemming from Cold War-era federal initiatives helped drive the emergence of the Sunbelt. These factors also shaped local race relations. In the case of the SRP, DuPont's deeply conservative ethos blunted opportunities for social change, but it also helped contain the radical white backlash that was so prominent in places like the Mississippi Delta that received less Cold War investment.</p></p><p>How the global war on communism transformed the SouthKARI FREDERICKSON is an associate professor and chair of the department of history at the University of Alabama.

A vicious campaign of persecution forced the faithful to go underground. For seven generations, Hidden Christians&#x2014;or Kirishitan&#x2014;preserved a faith that was strictly forbidden on pain of death. Illiterate peasants handed down the Catholicism that had been taught to their ancestors despite having no Bible or contact with the outside world.<br><br>Just as remarkably, descendants of the Hidden Christians continue to this day to practice their own religion, refusing to rejoin the Catholic Church. Why? And what is it about Christianity that is so antagonistic to Japanese culture? <i>In Search of Japan's Hidden Christians</i> is an attempt to answer these questions. A journey in both space and time, <i>In Search of Japan's Hidden Christians</i> recounts a clash of civilizations&#x2014;of East and West&#x2014;that resonates to this day and offers insights about the tenacity of belief and unchanging aspects of Japanese culture.</p><p>"One of the most compelling and important books on Japan in recent years.

Yet this emphatically does not mean that the Bible isn't, in some very real measure, true, argues scholar of mysticism Richard Smoley. <br><br>Smoley reviews the most authoritative historical evidence to demonstrate that figures such as Moses, Abraham, and Jesus are not only unlikely to have existed, but bear strong composite resemblances to other Near Eastern religious icons. Likewise, the geopolitical and military events of Scripture fail to mesh with the largely settled historical time line and social structures. Smoley meticulously shows how our concepts of the Hebrew and Christian God, including Christ himself, are an assemblage of ideas that were altered, argued over, and edited--until their canonization. This process, to a large degree, gave Western civilization its consensus view of God. <br><br>But these conclusions are not cause for nihilism or disbelief. Rather, beneath the metaphorical figures and mythical historicism of Scripture appears an extraordinary, truly transcendent theology born from the most sacred and fully realized spiritual and human insights of the antique Eastern world. Far from being "untrue," the Bible is remarkably, extraordinarily true as it connects us to the sublime insights of our ancient ancestors and points to a unifying ethic behind many of the world's faiths.</p><p>RICHARD SMOLEY is one of the world's most distinguished authorities on the mystical and esoteric teachings of Western civilization. A graduate of Harvard College and the University of Oxford, he was a longtime editor of the venerated spiritual journal <i>Gnosis</i>. Smoley is the author of books including <i>Inner Christianity, The Essential Nostradamus, The Deal: A Guide to Radical and Complete Forgiveness</i>, and<i> Forbidden Faith: The Secret History of Gnosticism. </i>He is currently editor of <i>Quest: Journal of the Theosophical Society in America</i>.&#x201c;Enormously comforting, encouraging and inspiring.

Jeffrey has written a number of autobiographical books for adults (<i>Clumsy</i>,&nbsp;<i>Unlikely</i>, and&nbsp;<i>A Matter of Life</i>, among others, all from Top Shelf Productions), humorous graphic novels about cats (<i>Cat Getting Out of a Bag</i>,&nbsp;<i>Cats Are Weird</i>, from Chronicle Books), and parodies like&nbsp;<i>Incredible Change-Bots&nbsp;</i>(and its two sequels, all also from Top Shelf).<br><br>His most recent project has been 40,000 years in the making:&nbsp;<i>Lucy &amp; Andy Neanderthal!</i>&nbsp;Lucy and Andy are a brother and sister living in the stone age, where they struggle to survive mammoths, cave bears, and their own sibling rivalry.&nbsp;<i>Lucy &amp; Andy Book Two: The Stone Cold Age&nbsp;</i>is available now.Brown's second autobiographical graphic novel mines similar territory to his debut, Clumsy. It tells of Brown losing his virginity at age 24 and the relationship that precedes and follows the event. Brown meets Allisyn at a party and they begin a slow courtship, culminating in a confused and uncomfortable sexual relationship, which then begins to eat away at their relationship in general. As with Clumsy, Brown makes an otherwise straightforward tale compelling. Unlikely is composed of vignettes, each isolating a moment in their relationship-a conversation, a party, hanging out-that deliver essential bits of thematic and emotional information. This allows readers to see the relationship as Brown experienced it, without the false strictures of quotidian continuity. We see the pair only in the context of their togetherness; there are no subplots or narrative detours. Brown's dialogue is perfect, lending the proceedings an unerring sense of authenticity. His drawing, ragged at first glance, is minimal, nuanced cartooning, using a minimum of lines for maximum effect. And remarkably, the work avoids the usual pitfalls of autobiographical comics: Brown never asks readers for pity, nor does he offer up a confession. There are no lyrical interludes, and the unsparing documentation ensures that voyeurism never enters into the mix. Through careful editing and scene selection, he lets the story unfold as though, in a sense, it didn't happen to him. Readers are left with only the exterior facts, and must make up their own minds about the characters based solely on what Brown shows. <br>Copyright 2003 Reed Business Information, Inc.</p><h2>All The Answers</h2><p><b>A 2019 EISNER AWARD NOMINEE FOR BEST REALITY-BASED WORK</b><br> <b>A NPR BEST BOOK OF 2018</b><br> <b>A <i>VULTURE</i> BEST COMIC OF 2018</b><br> <b>A <i>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY</i> BEST BOOK OF 2018</b><br> <b>A <i>LIBRARY JOURNAL</i> BEST BOOK OF 2018</b><br> <b>A NEW YORK PUBLIC LIBRARY BEST BOOK OF 2018</b><br> <b>WINNER OF THE <i>PUBLISHERS WEEKLY</i> 2018 GRAPHIC NOVEL CRITICS POLL</b><br> <br> In this moving graphic memoir, Eisner Award-winning writer and artist Michael Kupperman traces the life of his reclusive father&#x2014;the once-world-famous Joel Kupperman, Quiz Kid.

It is nothing short of remarkable that Child is not only able to continually reinvent his ex-military cop, but that each installment is better than the last. <em>Worth Dying For</em> finds our battered hero hiding in plain sight in a tiny Nebraska town, trying to recover from the catastrophe he left behind in South Dakota (no spoilers here, but readers are still arguing over <em>61 Hours</em>&#x2019;s cliffhanger ending).

Through an ever escalating onslaught of destruction, Operation Rolling Thunder intended to signal America&#x2019;s unwavering commitment to its South Vietnamese ally in the face of continued North Vietnamese aggression, break Hanoi&#x2019;s political will to prosecute the war, and bring about a negotiated settlement to the conflict. It was not to be. Against the backdrop of the Cold War and fears of widening the conflict into a global confrontation, Washington policy makers micromanaged and mismanaged the air campaign and increasingly muddled strategic objectives and operational methods that ultimately sowed the seeds of failure, despite the heroic sacrifices by U.S. Air Force and Navy pilots and crews <br><br>Despite flying some 306,000 combat sorties and dropping 864,000 tons of ordnance on North Vietnam &#x2013; 42 per cent more than that used in the Pacific theater during World War II &#x2013; Operation Rolling Thunder failed to drive Hanoi decisively to the negotiating table and end the war. That would take another four years and another air campaign. But by building on the hard earned political and military lessons of the past, the Nixon Administration and American military commanders would get another chance to prove themselves when they implemented operations Linebacker I and II in May and December 1972\. And this time the results would be vastly different.</p><p>Stephen Emerson was born in San Diego, California into a U.S. Navy family: his father was a career naval aviator and his mother a former Navy nurse. Steve grew up on various Navy bases during the Vietnam War. His father served two combat tours as an attack pilot in Vietnam flying the A-4 Skyhawk in Operation Rolling Thunder while flying off the USS Midway in 1965 with VA-22 and later as commanding officer of VA-146 flying the A-7 Corsair II while embarked on the USS Enterprise in 1969\. Steve worked as intelligence analyst covering political-military affairs in Africa and the Middle East. He served as Security Studies Chair at the National Defense University&#x2019;s Africa Center for Strategic Studies and previously as an associate professor of National Security Decision-making at the U.S. Naval War College in Newport, Rhode Island. As the author of more than 100 classified and unclassified publications, Steve has written widely on subjects from American national security affairs and political instability to terrorism, African conflicts, and counter-insurgency. Chief among these are his critical assessment of U.S. counter-terrorism policy in Africa, &#x2018;The Battle for Africa&#x2019;s Hearts and Minds&#x2019;, and his comprehensive military history of the Mozambican civil war in The Battle for Mozambique. He holds a Ph.D. in International Relations/Comparative Politics from the University of Florida and currently resides in Orlando, Florida.&#x201c;I strongly recommend Emerson&#x2019;s book to everyone from military member, to policy maker, to anyone interested in history.

In Spain, where he was known as &#x201c;el Bosco,&#x201d; his work earned considerable acclaim early in his career.</p><p>Bosch came from a long line of painters and soon mastered the skills of his craft. In stylistic terms, however, he departed from tradition, developing his own outlook. His inventive approach to both content and form is a hallmark of his work. Bosch played a pioneering role in the transformation of Flemish painting techniques in the early sixteenth century. Nowhere is this radical change more apparent than in his direct application of dabs of paint to the pictorial surface to create highlights and nuances or to define forms, almost as though he were drawing with the paintbrush.</p><p>This book, published for the exhibition at the Museo del Prado to mark the 500th anniversary of Bosch&#x2019;s death, provides up-to-date information on the artist&#x2019;s life and family, examines the data available regarding his patrons, surveys his status as painter and draftsman, and investigates his visual and textual sources as well as his values and ideology, with particular reference to <em>The Garden of Earthly Delights</em> and his depictions of Hell.

T. Barnum, Frederick Douglass, Harriet Beecher Stowe, and Foster's relative President James Buchanan all glimpsed in the background. The author's enviably broad knowledge of pop music . . . allows him to draw provocative and intelligent parallels with figures from American culture past and present."--<i>Washington Times</i></b><br><br>Stephen Foster (1826-1864) was America's first great songwriter and the first to earn his living solely through his music. He composed some 200 songs, including such classics as "Oh! Susanna," "Jeanie with the Light Brown Hair," "Old Folks at Home (Way down upon the Swanee River)," and "Camptown Races (Doo-dah! Doo-dah!)." He virtually invented popular music as we recognize it to this day, yet he died at age thirty-seven, a forgotten and nearly penniless alcoholic on the Bowery. The author reveals Foster's contradictory life while disclosing how the dynamics of nineteenth-century industrialization, westward expansion, the Gold Rush, slavery, and the Civil War infused his music, and how that music influenced popular culture.</p><p>Ken Emerson&#39;s thickly textured narrative features an affectionate examination of American music&#39;s diverse strands as well as a perceptive portrait of the nation&#39;s first great songwriter. Stephen Foster (1826-64) was born in Pittsburgh and visited the South only briefly, yet songs like &#34;My Old Kentucky Home&#34; and &#34;Oh! Susanna&#34; drew on black Southern culture to create a uniquely American form of popular music. The author is clear-sighted about the complex blend of racism and genuine compassion that infused Foster&#39;s &#34;blackface&#34; compositions.<b>Ken Emerson,</b> a former editor of <i>The New York Times Magazine</i> and <i>New York Newsday, </i>has written about popular music for thirty years.

For him three features made it very special<br><br>-The force with which it applies truth to the conscience.<br><br>-The way Owen plumbs the depths of Christian experience as a skillful physician of the soul.<br><br>-The uncovering of the secrets of the mind and heart so that the true spiritual state of the reader is discovered.<br><br>This book began life as a collection of meditations on Romans 8:6, which were written for the author's own benefit during a time of illness. Alarmed by the subtle power the world exercises over the mind, Owen shows us how to really live by raising our thoughts above all earthly objects and setting them on 'things above, where Christ is' (Col. 3:1)<br><br>A favorite book of William Wilberforce, it contains some passages which are not surpassed in all of Owen's writings.

How could it be that something so insubstantial fills us, and calms us, and makes us weep? Because, says W. A. Mathieu, music bridges mind and heart, self and other, and affirms our place in the world. Everyone uses the bridge of music, from casual listeners to devoted professionals.

He would leave behind his mundane existence in Moscow to re-create the legendary British explorer Henry Stanley&#x2019;s trip down the Congo in a dugout canoe, stocked with food, medicine, and even a gun-toting guide. But once his tiny boat pushed off the banks of this mysterious river, Tayler realized he was in a place where maps and supplies would have no bearing on his survival.

Yet she is known the world over by Catholics and non-Catholics alike. Her statue soon appeared in most Catholic churches in the world. With St. Joan of Arc, she shares the title "Patroness of France" and with St. Francis Xavier the honor of "Principal Patroness of all Missionaries." Her devotees acknowledge her as a second St. Jude in her powerful intercession with God. Her appeal is universal-from peasants to Popes-and people of all stations know her and call upon her for help.<br><br> What factors conspired to shape St. Therese of the Child Jesus? John Beevers addresses himself to this question in The Making of a Saint. As author of an earlier biography, The Storm of Glory, and as translator of her autobiography, The Story of a Soul, he brings to his task an authority on her life unsurpassed perhaps by any writer in English.<br><br> The story of this life is a marvel-a miracle-of divine grace. For the life of St. Therese is the lesson to all men of spiritual greatness to be achieved by perfect love of God and total consecration of all our actions, even the smallest, to His greater honor and glory.</p><p>John Beevers was an English author of the twentieth century, born in 1912 at Yorkshire. In the 1930s he started a career in journalism with the <i>Manchester Daily Dispatch</i>, before joining the B.B.C. in 1941. He remained there until 1969, eventually becoming an executive. He spent his spare time writing books, comprised mostly of saint biographies and translations of French spiritual works, including <i>Storm of Glory</i>, <i>Saint Therese: The Little Flower</i>, and <i>Virgin of the Poor</i>. He died on the thirteenth of September, 1975, and was survived by his wife, daughter and two grandchildren.<br></p><h2>Mastering Bach Flower Therapies: A Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment</h2><p>In <i>Mastering Bach Flower Therapies: A Guide to Diagnosis and Treatment</i>, Mechthild Scheffer presents a comprehensive guide to incorporating Bach flowers into your life.

American patriots eradicated the German language from schools, churches, and newspapers. Germans, once America&#x2019;s biggest, proudest, and most successful ethnic group were targets of hate, persecution, and even lynchings and vigilante hangings. German cooks were burned, newspapers were closed, and sauerkraut was renamed &#x201c;liberty cabbage&#x201d; &#x2014;the &#x201c;freedom fries&#x201d; of modern times.</p><p><b>Erik Kirschbaum</b> is a correspondent for the Reuters international news agency.

This gorgeous tapestry of literature and butterflies tells the story of Fyodor&#39;s pursuits as a writer. Its heroine is not Fyodor&#39;s elusive and beloved Zina, however, but Russian prose and poetry themselves.</p><p>For most of his life, Vladimir Nabokov was quite literally a man without a country. It's a small irony, then, that his career falls so neatly into national phases: Russian, German, French, and American, plus the protracted coda he spend in a Swiss luxury hotel during his final decade. <i>The Gift</i>, which he wrote between 1935 and 1937 in Berlin, is the grand summation of his second phase. It describes, for starters, the sentimental education of a young Russian writer, Fyodor Godunov-Cherdyntsev. This hyphenated creation has more than a few things in common with the author, despite Nabokov's vehement denial in the novel's foreword. Still, only a nitwit would read <i>The Gift</i> for its autobiographical revelations. What this early masterpiece <i>does</i> offer is a wealth of lyrical, witty, heartbreaking prose, beautifully translated from the Russian by Michael Scammell (with an assist from Nabokov himself). Who else would note the way a street rises "at a barely perceptible angle, beginning with a post office and ending with a church, like an epistolary novel"? Who else has ever administered the satirical shiv to his characters with such deadly, almost affectionate aplomb? <blockquote> Shirin himself was a thickset man with a reddish crew cut, always badly shaved and wearing large spectacles behind which, as in two aquariums, swam two tiny, transparent eyes--which were completely impervious to visual impressions. He was blind like Milton, deaf like Beethoven, and a blockhead to boot. </blockquote> Of course, only a fraction of <i>The Gift</i> is taken up with this sort of demolition derby. Fyodor's romance with Zina, for example, occasions the most ardent prose of Nabokov's career: "And not only was Zina cleverly and elegantly made to measure for him by a very painstaking fate, but both of them, forming a single shadow, were made to the measure of something not quite comprehensible, but wonderful and benevolent and continuously surrounding them." (Shades of Volodya and V�ra? Only the deceased husband and wife, and perhaps Stacy Schiff, know for sure.)<p> At the same time, <i>The Gift</i> is a brilliant, mesmerizing riff on the history of Russian literature, with elaborate bouquets tossed to Pushkin and Gogol. There's also a hilarious yet somehow tender evisceration of the do-gooding polemicist Nikolai Chernyshevski--which was suppressed, in fact, when the novel was originally serialized by a Russian �migr� magazine. As should be clear by now, <i>The Gift</i> defies any attempt at quick-and-dirty summary. But the book plays the most pleasurable kind of havoc with our stuffy notions of narrative structure and linguistic protocol. And as Nabokov repeatedly wraps the reader's consciousness around his little finger, he never holds back on that ultimate literary gift: pleasure. <i>--James Marcus</i></p>ft is the last of the novels Nabokov wrote in his native Russian and the crowning achievement of that period in his literary career.&nbsp;&nbsp;It is also his ode to Russian literature, evoking the works of Pushkin, Gogol, and others in the course of its narrative:&nbsp;&nbsp;the story of Fyodor Godunov-Cherdyntsev, an impoverished �migr� poet living in Berlin, who dreams of the book he will someday write--a book very much like <b>The Gift</b> itself.</p><h2>Dead and Gone: A Burke Novel</h2><p>From the modern master of noir, Andrew Vachss, comes this heart-topping and bestselling new thriller that completely reinvents the Burke series. <br> <br>Urban Outlaw Burke barely survives an attack by a professional hit squad that kills his partner.

There, in the unlikeliest of places, Mary discovers and helps restore an abandoned garden and, in the process, blossoms herself into a creature of loving kindness. Mary&#x2019;s transformation begins when she meets a no-nonsense housekeeper, a brusque gardener, and a sprightly robin that leads her to the hidden garden. With the help of Dickon, a boy with an almost supernatural affinity for animals and plants, and Colin, her frail cousin, Mary works in secret to bring new life to the old garden. The three friends find their efforts rewarded not only with all the pleasure that blooming flowers bring, but also the blessings of good health and high spirits.<br>Since its initial appearance in 1911, this cherished classic of children&#x2019;s literature by the author of A Little Princess has enchanted readers.

Along the way, she manages to cure her sickly cousin Colin, who is every bit as imperious as she. These two are sullen little peas in a pod, closed up in a gloomy old manor on the Yorkshire moors of England, until a locked-up garden captures their imaginations and puts the blush of a wild rose in their cheeks; "It was the sweetest, most mysterious-looking place any one could imagine. The high walls which shut it in were covered with the leafless stems of roses which were so thick, that they matted together.... 'No wonder it is still,' Mary whispered. 'I am the first person who has spoken here for ten years.'" As new life sprouts from the earth, Mary and Colin's sour natures begin to sweeten. For anyone who has ever felt afraid to live and love, <i>The Secret Garden</i>'s portrayal of reawakening spirits will thrill and rejuvenate. Frances Hodgson Burnett creates characters so strong and distinct, young readers continue to identify with them even 85 years after they were conceived. <i>(Ages 9 to 12)</i>What secrets lie behind the doors at Misselthwaite Manor? Recently arrived at her uncle's estate, orphaned Mary Lennox is spoiled, sickly, and certain she won't enjoy living there. Then she discovers the arched doorway into an overgrown garden, shut up since the death of her aunt ten years earlier. Mary soon begins transforming it into a thing of beauty--unaware that she is changing too. <p></p> <p>But Misselthwaite hides another secret, as mary discovers one night. High in a dark room, away from the rest of the house, lies her young cousin, Colin, who believes he is an incurable invalid, destined to die young. His tantrums are so frightful, no one can reason with him. If only, Mary hopes, she can get Colin to love the secret garden as much as she does, its magic will work wonders on him.</p></p><h2>The Incredible Adventures of Professor Branestawm</h2><p>Professor Branestawm is the most absent-minded inventor you&#39;ll ever meet and no matter how hard he tries his brilliant ideas never seem to keep him out of crazy scrapes.</p><p>Norman Hunter was born in 1899 in Sydenham, London.

Gone is the clash of blocs, but replaced by what? <br><br>Thomas Barnett has the answers. A senior military analyst with the U.S. Naval War College, he has given a constant stream of briefings over the past few years, and particularly since 9/11, to the highest of high-level civilian and military policymakers-and now he gives it to you. <b>The</b> <b>Pentagon's New Map</b> is a cutting-edge approach to globalization that combines security, economic, political, and cultural factors to do no less than predict and explain the nature of war and peace in the twenty-first century. <br><br>Building on the works of Friedman, Huntington, and Fukuyama, and then taking a leap beyond, Barnett crystallizes recent American military history and strategy, sets the parameters for where our forces will likely be headed in the future, outlines the unique role that America can and will play in establishing international stability-and provides much-needed hope at a crucial yet uncertain time in world history. <br><br>For anyone seeking to understand the Iraqs, Afghanistans, and Liberias of the present and future, the intimate new links between foreign policy and national security, and the operational realities of the world as it exists today, <b>The Pentagon's New Map</b> is a template, a Rosetta stone. Agree with it, disagree with it, argue with it-there is no book more essential for 2004 and beyond.</p><p>This bold and important book strives to be a practical "strategy for a Second American Century." In this brilliantly argued work, Thomas Barnett calls globalization "this country&#x2019;s gift to history" and explains why its wide dissemination is critical to the security of not only America but the entire world. As a senior military analyst for the U.S. Naval War College, Barnett is intimately familiar with the culture of the Pentagon and the State Department (both of which he believes are due for significant overhauls). He explains how the Pentagon, still in shock at the rapid dissolution of the once evil empire, spent the 1990s grasping for a long-term strategy to replace containment. The terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001, Barnett argues, revealed the gap between an outdated Cold War-era military and a radically different one needed to deal with emerging threats. He believes that America is the prime mover in developing a "future worth creating" not because of its unrivaled capacity to wage war, but due to its ability to ensure security around the world. Further, he believes that the U.S. has a moral responsibility to create a better world and the way he proposes to do that is by bringing all nations into the fold of globalization, or what he calls connectedness. Eradicating disconnectedness, therefore, is "the defining security task of our age." His stunning predictions of a U.S. annexation of much of Latin America and Canada within 50 years as well as an end to war in the foreseeable future guarantee that the book will be controversial. And that's good. <i>The Pentagon's New Map</i> deserves to be widely discussed. Ultimately, however, the most impressive aspects of the book is not its revolutionary ideas but its overwhelming optimism. Barnett wants the U.S. to pursue the dream of global peace with the same zeal that was applied to preventing global nuclear war with the former Soviet Union. High-level civilian policy makers and top military leaders are already familiar with his vision of the future&#x2014;this book is a briefing for the rest of us and it cannot be ignored. --<i>Shawn Carkonen</i>Thomas P.

The Japanese Zen Master Hakuin (1689&#x2013;1769) considered the experience to be essential. In his autobiography he says: &#x201c;Anyone who would call himself a member of the Zen family must first achieve kensho-realization of the Buddha&#x2019;s way. If a person who has not achieved kensho says he is a follower of Zen, he is an outrageous fraud. A swindler pure and simple.&#x201d; <br><br>Hakuin&#x2019;s short text on kensho, &#x201c;Four Ways of Knowing of an Awakened Person,&#x201d; is a little-known Zen classic. The &#x201c;four ways&#x201d; he describes include the way of knowing of the Great Perfect Mirror, the way of knowing equality, the way of knowing by differentiation, and the way of the perfection of action. Rather than simply being methods for &#x201c;checking&#x201d; for enlightenment in oneself, these ways ultimately exemplify Zen practice.

The city watch frowned on citizens taking the law into their own hands like that, but the watch was notoriously short-handed in the Districts. They couldn't prosecute what they didn't know about, and I'd rather they didn't know Quentin was here tonight.<br><br>Quentin occasionally works for me. My name is Raine Benares. I'm a seeker. I find things. Most times the people who hire me are glad when I do, but sometimes they're sorry they asked. Personally, I think people should be more careful what they ask for. Some things are better left unfound.<br><br>Seeking isn't the flashiest occupation a sorceress can put out her shingle for, or the most highly regarded, but it pays the rent on time. I've found the formerly unfindable for the Mermeia city watch, and since I'm an elf, elven intelligence has sought my help on more than one occasion. Most of what I'm hired to find didn't get lost by itself. It had help. Help you could depend on to use blades or bolts or nastier magical means to keep what they went to all the trouble to get. When that's the case, I go by the rule of me or them.<br><br>I also apply that rule to my friends. That's why I was cooling my heels in one of Mermeia's more aromatic alleys&#x2014;to keep Quentin's moonlighting from earning him a one-way trip to the city morgue.<br><br>As a former career thief, Quentin knew the underside of Mermeia better than just about anyone. That's why I hired him. Well, it was one of the reasons. Our professional paths had crossed from time to time over the years. What I had been hired to find was often something Quentin had been hired to steal. It got to the point that I just started my search with Quentin to save myself a lot of unnecessary footwork. He didn't take it personally, and neither did I. However, I always extended to Quentin the professional courtesy of waiting until the object in question had left his hands before recovering it. That way he got paid while maintaining his reputation. But when the risks started to outweigh the rewards, Quentin thought that an early end to his career might keep the same fate from befalling his life. I helped him bridge the gap between thief and quasi-law-abiding citizen.<br><br>No fact, tidbit or rumor was too small or too hidden for Quentin to ferret out&#x2014;given the proper monetary motivation. Greed still occasionally whispered sweet nothings in his ear, enticing my sometime employee to seek out additional means of income. Most times he didn't tell me the details. Most times I didn't want to know. Considering where he was right now, tonight wasn't one of those times.<br><br>The city of Mermeia in the kingdom of Brenir consisted of five islands that had been forced into existence by the determination of its founders, and kept from sinking by the greed of its merchants. A powerful force, greed. It made solid ground where there had once been marsh; built palaces and trading houses where there were reeds; and inspired humans, elves, goblins, and magic users of all races to live together in a city separated only by the canals that marked their respective Districts. Sometimes we even got along.<br><br>I cupped my hands to my mouth, blowing on cold-numbed fingers. I was trying to breathe through my mouth to keep my nose from becoming any more traumatized than it already was. The cozy little alley I'd found across Pasquine Street from Nigel's townhouse held a charm all its own. I'd put a shielding spell across the entrance, so unless Quentin walked over and looked in, he couldn't see or hear me. The alley walls were slick with something dark and damp and best left unidentified. The air was chilly but still warm enough to enhance the aroma of the garbage sharing the alley with me. And the stench of the canal a block away at low tide only further enhanced my sensory experience. I rubbed my hands together, then gave up and reached for the gloves at my belt. Not that I wanted anything to happen to Quentin, but it would be nice if all this turned out to be worth my while.<br><br>"You stood me up."<br><br>I yelped. I recognized the voice, which was the only reason my throwing knife remained in my hand, instead of being lodged in the voice's owner.<br><br>I blew out my breath. "Don't do that!" I sheathed my knife, though I was still tempted to use it, more from acute embarrassment than anything else.<br><br>Phaelan chuckled and stepped out of the shadows hiding the alley entrance from the street. My cousin looked like the rest of my family&#x2014;dark hair, dark eyes, dark good looks, equally dark disposition. Next to them, I stood out like a flaming match at night with my long red gold hair, gray eyes, and pale skin. The hair and skin tone were from my mother. I assumed my eyes were from my father. Neither parent was around for me to ask.<br><br>Phaelan was the main reason having the name Benares was an asset in the seeking business. When looking for pilfered goods, it helped to be related to experts&#x2014;professional pilferers all.<br><br>You could say our family was well known in the import and export business. The goods my cousin's side of the family imported never saw the light of day in a harbormaster's ledger, and the exports consisted of vast profits sent to secret family accounts in various banks in numerous kingdoms. Phaelan's natural talent was in acquisitions. Many times he neglected to get permission from the owners whose goods he intended to acquire; or when he did ask, his request often came from the business end of a cannon.<br><br>"Since when does spending the night in an alley rate above dinner with me at the Crown and Anchor?" he asked.<br><br>"Since Quentin's moonlighting again."<br><br>"Varek said you were staking out Nigel Nicabar's. He didn't say anything about Quentin."<br><br>When in Mermeia, Phaelan did business out of the Spyglass, and Varek Akar, the proprietor, served the dual purpose of business manager and social secretary for my cousin when he was in town. I didn't normally make my stakeouts public knowledge, but since Nigel was involved, I thought it'd be a good idea to let my next of kin know where to find me.<br><br>"That's because I didn't mention Quentin," I told him. "I'd rather the watch not get wind that he's working again."<br><br>"Varek knows how to keep his mouth shut."<br><br>"I trust Varek, but I don't feel the same way about his new barkeep. Quentin hasn't done anything illegal tonight."<br><br>Phaelan laughed, his voice low. "Night ain't over yet."<br><br>He was right, but I didn't have to admit it. If certain members of the watch knew where he was, they'd jump to conclusions, and then they'd jump Quentin.<br><br>Phaelan's ship had arrived in port late that afternoon, and the plan had been to meet for an early dinner. Early, because I knew he had plans later&#x2014;plans that had everything to do with a woman, but nothing to do with a lady. My cousin had a strict threefold agenda on his first night in any port&#x2014;get fed, get laid, and get drunk, in that order. Occasionally he would skip the food, but never the other two. When in Mermeia, my cousin could either be found in one of the city's less reputable gambling parlors, or enjoying the comforts offered at Madame Natasha's Joy Garden, and probably the attentions of Madame Natasha herself. This evening, Phaelan was positively resplendent in a doublet of scarlet buckskin, with matching breeches topped with high, black leather boots. At his side was the swept-hilt rapier he favored when out on the town. And unless my nose deceived me, his white linen shirt was as well scrubbed as Phaelan himself. An earring set with a single ruby gleamed in the lobe of one elegantly pointed ear. I knew all the fuss wasn't on account of me.<br><br>"You took a bath," I said. "And shaved. I'm impressed."<br><br>"Just fancying myself up for you, darlin'."<br><br>"I'm sure Madame Natasha and her girls will also appreciate your consideration."<br><br>He grinned in a flash of white teeth. It was the kind of grin that could get him anything he wanted at Madame Natasha's&#x2014;or anywhere else in Mermeia&#x2014;for free. He nodded toward where Quentin still waited by Nigel's side door. "So what's he doing here?"<br><br>"Asking for more trouble than he can handle."<br><br>The grin broadened. "From Nigel or you?"<br><br>"Both."<br><br>"Then walk across the street and stop him. The Crown's still holding a table for us."<br><br>"It's not that easy."<br><br>"Why not?"<br><br>"Being here wasn't his idea."<br><br>"So someone paid him well. Wouldn't be the first time. Let's go and let the man earn his money."<br><br>I didn't budge. "How much would it take for you to break into Nigel's at night?"<br><br>To his credit, Phaelan didn't have to think long. "More money than most in this city can lay hands to."<br><br>"Exactly. And Quentin's terrified of necromancers. There's more involved here than money, meaning whoever hired Quentin scares him more than Nigel does. Quentin's been trying to keep his nose clean and someone won't let him&#x2014;and I don't like it."<br><br>"So ask him who it is."<br><br>"I did."<br><br>"And?"<br><br>"Quentin bought a new set of picklocks last week and started keeping to himself. I started asking him questions. He started avoiding me." I indicated the assortment of armaments and dark leather that made up my evening ensemble&#x2014;all topped by a ridiculously large and hooded cloak to keep Quentin from recognizing me had he spotted me. As an added precaution, my hair was contained in a long braid and hidden under the cloak. "Hence the cloak-and-dagger routine."<br><br>"So if he won't tell you what he's up to, you're just going to follow him while he does it."<br><br>I nodded. "Exactly. And pull his backside out of the fire if need be. Afterward, we're going to have a little chat." I glanced back at the alley entrance. Phaelan hadn't brought any of his crew with him. That was surprising.<br><br>"You alone?"<br><br>"My men only want to end up in an alley after they've been drinking all night&#x2014;or if they're waiting for someone. Even if they knew they'd be sharing that alley with you, I'd have a mutiny in the making."<br><br>I didn't have a response for that. I'd have mutinied, too. We settled back and waited.<br><br>A chat with Quentin was a given, but I hoped pulling his backside out of the fire wasn't going to be a part of my evening. Though with Quentin's current track record, both were probably in my immediate future.<br><br>Two months ago, Quentin had been hired to steal an emerald necklace being delivered to a local duke. The jeweler reported the theft to the duke. His Grace wasn't home, but his wife was. Unfortunately for everyone concerned, the duchess despised emeralds&#x2014;but they were the favorite gem of the woman she suspected of being her husband's mistress. Bad went to worse for both the duke and Quentin. The duke simply retreated to his country estate. Quentin had to hide in the Daith Swamp for three weeks. He emerged a changed man. I guess three weeks of eating nothing but silt slugs will do that to you.<br><br>I found out about all this after the fact. When Quentin got around to admitting his career relapse to me, he also admitted that the job could have gone better. My friends on the city watch thought Quentin's flair for understatement was exceeded only by his bad luck&#x2014;or stupidity&#x2014;depending on who you asked.<br><br>Yet here he was tonight, about to break into the house of the nastiest necromancer Mermeia had to offer. Some people were slow learners. But I would say that if Quentin was looking for a fate worse than eating silt slugs in a swamp, he'd come to the right place.<br><br>About ten minutes passed, and Quentin hadn't so much as flinched. I couldn't say the same for Phaelan. Three months at sea had taken its toll. There was something he desperately wanted to be doing right now, and standing in a stinking alley listening to himself breathe wasn't it.<br><br>"Go on, Phaelan. Nothing's going to happen here that I can't handle."<br><br>"Not a chance. Nigel isn't known for being understanding of trespassers."<br><br>"I'm not trespassing; Quentin is." I flashed Phaelan a grin of my own. "Besides, Nigel's not home. If he were, I wouldn't let Quentin within three blocks of here."<br><br>"Then what the hell's he waiting for?"<br><br>"Him." I indicated the upstairs gallery. A tall, thin figure carrying a single lamp proceeded at a stately pace down the length of the second floor gallery, putting out lamps and candles as he went.<br><br>"Nigel's steward," I clarified. "His reputation is almost as nasty as his master's. I did some asking around. It's the same routine every night. He puts out all the lights before going to bed. Nigel won't be back until just before daybreak. He's out making housecalls. For some reason, his clients seem to think s�ances have to be done at night. Since Quentin's the cautious type, he'll wait until the steward gets to the servant's quarters before he makes his move."<br><br>Phaelan's expression indicated I was in dire need of a life. I wasn't entirely sure I disagreed with him.<br><br>"How long have you been staking this place out?" he asked.<br><br>"Just once. The rest came from a few well-placed bribes. If Nigel doesn't want his people to gossip, he should pay them better."<br><br>"Any idea what Quentin's after?"<br><br>"Not a clue. But if Nigel holds it near and dear, you can bet it's a short list of people who want it&#x2014;or want to be anywhere near it."<br><br>"So that explains your sudden maternal urges."<br><br>"I'm just here to make sure Quentin doesn't get in too far over his head."<br><br>"I'd say he's there already. You planning to follow him in?"<br><br>"Not unless something jumps out and starts killing him."<br><br>"Then how are you...?" Phaelan began. Then understanding dawned. "How did you get him to take a tracking stone?"<br><br>"Who says I asked him?" I shrugged deeper into my cloak. "Better safe than sensed. And as an added bonus, Quentin gets to go inside where it's nice and warm, and we get to stay here where it's nice and smelly."<br><br>Phaelan looked up at the now dark gallery windows. "I don't think anything in there is nice." He took a not-so-delicate sniff and looked down at his boots in disgust. "Or out here."<br><br>I followed his gaze, and took a whiff of my own. I had really been trying to ignore my boots. Though I'd rather be in a stinking alley than a necromancer's house. Especially this necromancer. I'd once heard Nigel's place described as forbidding. Just plain spooky worked for me. I think he had both in mind when he had it built. Not many people would want to live in a place that looked like a mausoleum, but then Nigel wasn't most people.<br><br>My back was starting to cramp, and I shifted my weight, trying to get comfortable. The more I squirmed, the worse it got. I hated stake...</p><h2>The Secret History of Marvel Comics: Jack Kirby and the Moonlighting Artists at Martin Goodman&#39;s Empire</h2><p>The Secret History of Marvel Comics: Jack Kirby and the Moonlighting Artists at Martin Goodman's Empire digs back to the 1930s when Marvel Comics wasn't just a comic-book producing company. Marvel was but a small part of owner Martin Goodman's publishing empire, which had begun years before he published his first comic book. Goodman mostly published lurid and sensationalist story books (known as pulps) and magazines, featuring sexually charged detective and romance short fiction and celebrity gossip scandal sheets. Artists like Jack Kirby, who was producing Captain America for eight-year-olds, were dipping their toes in both ponds. The Secret History of Marvel Comics tells this parallel story of 1930s/40s Marvel Comics sharing offices with those Goodman publications not quite fit for children. <br></p><p>Blake Bell is the author of Strange &amp; Stranger (a retrospective of Spider-Man co-creator Steve Ditko); The Secret History of Marvel Comics, Fire &amp; Water: Bill Everett, The Sub-Mariner, and the Birth of Marvel Comics; Amazing Mysteries: The Bill Everett Archives; and Strange Suspense and Unexplored Worlds (two volumes in The Steve Ditko Archives).

The novel is part of a reissue programme for all of Fitzgerald&#39;s titles in Flamingo.</p><p><i>Offshore</i> possesses perfect, very odd pitch. In just over 130 pages of the wittiest and most melancholy prose, Penelope Fitzgerald limns the lives of "creatures neither of firm land nor water"--a group of barge-dwellers in London's Battersea Reach, circa 1961. One man, a marine artist whose commissions have dropped off since the war, is attempting to sell his decrepit craft before it sinks. Another, a dutiful businessman with a bored, mutinous wife, knows he should be landlocked but remains drawn to the muddy Thames. A third, Maurice, a male prostitute, doesn't even protest when a criminal acquaintance begins to use his barge as a depot for stolen goods: "The dangerous and the ridiculous were necessary to his life, otherwise tenderness would overwhelm him." <p> At the center of the novel--winner of the 1979 Booker Prize--are Nenna and her truant six- and 11-year-old daughters. The younger sibling "cared nothing for the future, and had, as a result, a great capacity for happiness." But the older girl is considerably less blithe. "Small and thin, with dark eyes which already showed an acceptance of the world's shortcomings," Fitzgerald writes, she "was not like her mother and even less like her father. The crucial moment when children realise that their parents are younger than they are had long since been passed by Martha." </p><p> Their father is farther afield. Unable to bear the prospect of living on the <i>Grace</i>, he's staying in Stoke Newington, part of London but a lost world to his wife and daughters. Meanwhile, Nenna spends her time going over incidents that seem to have led to her current situation, and the matter of some missing squash racquets becomes of increasing import. Though she is peaceful by nature, experience and poverty are wearing Nenna down. Her confidante Maurice, after a momentary spell of optimism, also returns to his life of little expectation and quiet acceptance: "Tenderly responsive to the self-deceptions of others, he was unfortunately too well able to understand his own." </p><p> Penelope Fitzgerald views her creations with deep but wry compassion. Having lived on a barge herself, she offers her expert spin on the dangers, graces, and whimsies of river life. Nenna, too, has become a savant, instantly recognizing on one occasion that the mud encasing the family cat is not from the Reach. This "sagacious brute" is almost as complex as his human counterparts, constantly forced to adjust her notions of vermin and authority. Though Stripey is capable of catching and killing very young rats, the older ones chase <i>her</i>. "The resulting uncertainty as to whether she was coming or going had made her, to some extent, mentally unstable." </p><p> As always, Fitzgerald is a master of the initially bizarre juxtaposition. Adjacent sentences often seem like delightful non sequiturs--until they flash together in an effortless evocation of character, era, and human absurdity. Nenna recalls, for instance, how the buds had dropped off the plant her husband rushed to the hospital when Martha was born. She "had never criticized the bloomless azalea. It was the other young mothers in the beds each side of her who had laughed at it. That had been 1951. Two of the new babies in the ward had been christened Festival." Tiny comical epiphanies such as these have caused the author to be dubbed a "British miniaturist." Yet the phrase utterly misses the risks Fitzgerald's novellas take, the discoveries they make, and the endless pleasures they provide. <i>--Kerry Fried</i></p>Mariner paperback, 1998, previous ISBN&nbsp;978-0-395-47804-2</p><h2>The Triumph of God over Evil: Theodicy for a World of Suffering (Strategic Initiatives in Evangelical Theology)</h2><p>Noted philosopher William Hasker explores a full range of issues concerning the problem of evil. Having taken account of the current state of the discussion and squarely facing some of the most trenchant arguments marshaled by John K. Roth and D. Z. Phillips, Hasker forges a constructive answer in some depth showing why the evil in the world does not provide evidence of a moral fault in God, the world&#39;s creator and governor. A fresh and provocative contribution to the ongoing discussion of theodicy.</p><p>William Hasker (Ph.D., University of Edinburgh) is professor emeritus of philosophy at Huntington College in Huntington, Indiana. His books include <em>Metaphysics: Constructing a World View; God, Time, and Knowledge; Reason and Religious Belief</em> (with Michael Peterson, David Basinger and Bruce Reichenbach); <em>The Openness of God</em> (with Clark Pinnock, Richard Rice, John Sanders and David Basinger); <em>Philosophy of Religion: Selected Readings</em> (edited with Michael Peterson, David Basinger and Bruce Reichenbach); <em>The Emergent Self; Middle Knowledge: Theory and Applications</em> (edited with David Basinger and Eef Dekker) and <em>Providence, Evil and the Openness of God.</em>"It is extremely readable, frequently quite persuasive, explicates difficult arguments clearly, and is extremely creative. It is not only a worthwhile read for the professional philosopher and theologian; it would make a wonderful text in any class on the philosophy of religion. This is one more exceptional achievement in a career that is full of the, and Hasker deserves congratulation for this fine effort." (Kenneth Einar Himma, The Journal of Religious Studies, Volume 47, 2011)<br><br>In <em>The Triumph of God Over Evil,</em> Christian philosopher William Hasker provides a generally comprehensive treatment of the problem of evil and a defense of free will (or open) theism that is both coherent and eminently readable despite the complexity of the issues with which he deals. (Mark H. Mann, Religious Studies Review, March 2009)<br><br>"This book is not simply a compilation of Hasker's earlier helpful work on the standard challenges to God's goodness allegedly posed by evil. Hasker here also offers us a thoughtful assessment of a number of recent challenges, especially those based on God's relationship with the natural order. I am especially impressed by his provocative analysis of evolution and its relationship to evil. And I feel that the type of ultimate triumph of good over evil Hasker outlines is one that rightly preserves a strong sense of divine sovereignty without diminishing our role and responsibility as humans." (David Basinger, professor of philosophy and ethics, Roberts Wesleyan College)<br><br>"Hasker's book is a model of first-rate philosophy. Beginners are unlikely to get a better introduction to the problem of evil; Hasker is a master at summarizing and getting hold of the core of the issues at stake. Veterans will be brought up to speed on the current debate; Hasker is sure-footed and fair in his assessment of friend and foe.

Here, writing at white heat and with such ferocious honesty and indignation that his book was to remain unpublishable for more than a century after its composition, Stendhal revisits his unhappy childhood in a stuffy provincial town and bares his rebellious heart. His adored mother, who died when he was only seven; a father devoted only to his own social ambitions; the aunt whose daily cruelties passed for care: these are among the indelible portraits in a work that captures the sights, sounds, places, and characters of Stendhal's youth, its pleasures and sorrows, with preternatural clarity and immediacy. Full of dazzling images and burning emotions, <i>The Life of Henry Brulard</i> is a vivid memoir that is also an extraordinary work of the imagination.</p><p><b>Stendhal</b> (1783&#x2013;1842), the pen name of Henri Marie Beyle, was born into a prosperous family in Grenoble. At sixteen he set out for Paris, intending to pursue a career as an engineer, but instead enlisted in Napoleon&#x2019;s Army. Stendhal took part in campaigns in Italy, Germany, Russia, and Austria, and then, after Napoleon&#x2019;s fall from power, settled in Milan,where he wrote books on art and music. Expelled from Italy for political reasons in 1821, he returned to Paris; following the 1830 revolution, he secured the position, which he was to hold for the rest of his life, of French Consul to Civitavecchia. Stendhal&#x2019;s great novels <i>The Red and the Black</i> (1830) and <i>The Charterhouse of Parma</i> (1839) were largely ignored during his lifetime, and many of his works remained unfinished and were published only posthumously. Among his most important books are <i>On Love, Lucien Leuwen, The Memoirs of an Egotist,</i> and <i>The Life of Henry Brulard.</i>Text: English (translation)<br> Original Language: French</p><h2>Carol and John Steinbeck: Portrait of a Marriage (Western Literature and Fiction Series)</h2><p>Carol Henning Steinbeck, writer John Steinbeck&#x2019;s first wife, was his creative anchor, the inspiration for his great work of the 1930s, culminating in <i>The Grapes of Wrath</i>. Meeting at Lake Tahoe in 1928, their attachment was immediate, their personalities meshing in creative synergy. Carol was unconventional, artistic, and compelling. In the formative years of Steinbeck&#x2019;s career, living in San Francisco, Pacific Grove, Los Gatos, and Monterey, their Modernist circle included Ed Ricketts, Joseph Campbell, and Lincoln Steffens. In many ways Carol&#x2019;s story is all too familiar: a creative and intelligent woman subsumes her own life and work into that of her husband. Together, they brought forth one of the enduring novels of the 20th century.&nbsp;</p><p>Susan Shillinglaw, professor of English at San Jose State University, directed the Center for Steinbeck Studies there from 1987 to 2005.

She is currently scholar in residence at the National Steinbeck Center in Salinas and lives in Pacific Grove, CA."Shillinglaw contends the Pulitzer Prize&#x2013;winning <i>Grapes of Wrath</i> is their 'shared creation.' She argues that Carol was a much larger influence on the novelist&#x2019;s life and work than has been previously acknowledged. In this lively, absorbing biography, she describes John&#x2019;s and Carol&#x2019;s families, the impact of friends and travel, and the creative process that culminated in John&#x2019;s writing. Carol left few written records or letters, thus her life is portrayed here from previously unavailable scrapbooks, photographs, and poetry. . . .

Thus we have <i>Carol and John Steinbeck: Portrait of a Marriage</i>. And in this new book, Shillinglaw makes a powerful case for the idea that Steinbeck&#x2019;s first wife had everything to do with his ability to persevere, to create a body of work that drew notice to his burgeoning talent, and to carry on despite all the pressures (fiscal, psychological, and otherwise) that plague serious writers attempting to emerge. . . . This wonderful new biography offers plenty of echoes of Steinbeck, but its real value is in restoring to memory the voice, style, and persona of Carol Henning Steinbeck."&#x2014;M. J.

Taken from his papers held at the Amistad Research Center in New Orleans, this vital collection brings together Dent's fiction, poetry, essays, interviews, and drama, including many previously unpublished works. With introductions by Kalamu ya Salaam, <i>New Orleans Griot: A Tom Dent Reader </i> showcases the remarkable life and writing of Tom Dent, from his early days in New York to working with the Free Southern Theatre in Mississippi to his astute observations of New Orleans and the black Mardi Gras Indians.</p><p>Tom Dent was an African American poet, essayist, oral historian, dramatist, and cultural activist. He was one of the founders of the New York based Umbra Writer&#39;s Workshop, the first major post-sixties organization of Black writers. Dent also served as the associate director of the Free Southern Theatre, founded the New Orleans based Congo Square Writer&#39;s Union, and co-founded Callaloo, A Quarterly Journal of African and African American Arts and Letters. Kalamu ya Salaam is an American poet, author, filmmaker, and teacher from the 9th Ward of New Orleans. A well-known activist and social critic, Salaam has spoken out on a number of racial and human rights issues."A comprehensive portrait of the influential New Orleans writer whose oeuvre reflects the racial tensions of the times and is equally relevant today." <i>Kirkus Reviews</i></p><h2>Greek Coins and Their Values (Hb) Vol 1: Europe</h2><p>The first volume of this catalogue deals with the issues of the Greek cities in Spain, Gaul, Italy, Sicily, Macedon and Thrace, Illyria and Central Greece, the Peloponnese, the Aegean Islands and Crete; also the Punic and RomanoCeltiberian coinage of Spain, and the Celtic coinages of Gaul, Britain (uninscribed issues), and Central Europe.

She received her undergraduate from the University of Maine at Presque Isle, where she majored in English, minored in History, and received a teaching certificate she had no intention of ever using. Since then, she has studied literature, veterinary medicine, ancient Greek among other things, and worked as a necropsy technician, a house painter, an office worker, a freelance editor, a freelance journalist (www.sff.net/people/Lynn.Flewelling/OtherWritings.html), and yes, even as a teacher now and then, an instructor of workshops&#x2014;on creativity and fiction writing.Chapter 1<br>The cold night breeze shifted, blowing stinging smoke from old Teolin's campfire into Mahti's eyes. The young witch blinked it away, but remained squatting motionless, his bearskin cloak pulled around him like a little hut. It was bad luck to fidget during this last crucial step of the making.<br><br>The old witch hummed happily as he heated his knife again and again, using the tip and edge to incise the rings of dark, intricate patterns that now covered most of the long wooden tube. Teolin was ancient. His wrinkled brown skin hung on his skinny frame like old cloth and his bones showed through. The witch marks on his face and body were hard to read, distorted by the ravages of time. <br><br>His hair hung over his shoulders in a thin tangle of yellowed strands. Years of making had left his blunt, knobby fingers stained black, but they were as nimble as ever.<br>***<br>Mahti's last oo'lu had cracked one cold night this past midwinter, after he'd played out an elder's gallstones. It had taken months of searching to find the right kind of bildi branch to make a new one. Bildi trees weren't scarce, but you had to find a sapling trunk or large branch that had been ant-hollowed, and the right size to give a good tone. "High as your chin, and four fingers broad"; so he'd been taught and so it was. <br><br>He'd found plenty of flawed branches in the hills around his village: knotted ones, cracked ones, others with holes eaten out through the side. The large black ants that followed the rising sap through the heartwood were industrious but undiscerning craftsmen. <br><br>He'd finally found one, and cut his horn stave from it. But it was bad luck for a witch to make his own instrument, even if he had the skill. Each must be earned and given from the hand of another. So he'd strapped it to his back over his bearskin cloak and snowshoed for three days and nights to bring it to Teolin. <br><br>The old man was the best oo'lu maker in the eastern hills. Witch men had been coming to him for three generations and he turned away more than he accepted.<br><br>It took weeks to make an oo'lu. During this time it was Mahti's job to chop wood, cook food, and generally make himself useful while Teolin worked. <br><br>Teolin first stripped the bark and used live coals to burn out the last of the ants' leavings. When the stave was fully hollowed he went out of earshot to test the tone. Satisfied, he and Mahti rested and traded spells for a week while the hollow branch hung drying in the rafters near the smoke hole of Teolin's hut.<br><br>It dried without warping or cracking. Teolin sawed the ends square and rubbed beeswax into the wood until it gleamed. Then they'd waited two more days for the full moon. <br><br>Tonight was the sit-still. <br><br>That afternoon Mahti had scraped away the snow in front of the hut and dragged out an old lion skin for Teolin to sit on. He laid a large fire, with more wood stacked within easy reach, and hunkered down to tend it. <br><br>Teolin sat down wrapped in his moth-eaten bearskin and set to work. Using a heated iron knife, he etched the rings of magic onto the wood. Mahti watched with rapt attention as he fed the fire, marveling at how the designs seemed to flow from the tip of the blade, like ink onto deerskin. He wondered if it would come so easily to him, when the time came for him to make oo'lus for others?<br><br>Now the Mother's full white face was high overhead and Mahti's ankles ached from squatting, but the oo'lu was nearly done. <br><br>When the last of the rings was complete, Teolin dipped the mouth end in a little pot of melted wax, then rolled a softened lump of it into a thin coil and pressed it in a ring to the waxed end of the horn. He squinted across at Mahti, gauging the size of his mouth, and pinched the wax in until the opening was about two thumbs wide.<br><br>Satisfied at last, he gave Mahti a toothless grin. "Ready to learn this one's name?" <br><br>Mahti's heart beat faster as he stood and stretched the stiffness from his legs. His last oo'lu, Moon Plow, had served him seven years. In that time he'd become a man and a healer. Honoring the Moon Plow mark, he'd planted many fine children in women's bellies at Mother Shek'met's festivals. His sons and daughters were scattered through three valleys and some of the oldest were already showing witch's talent. <br><br>When Moon Plow cracked, this cycle of his life ended. He was twenty-three summers old, and his next future was about to be revealed.<br><br>Drawing his own knife, he cut his right palm and held it over the mouth of the oo'lu as Teolin held it. A few drops of his blood fell inside it as he sang the claiming spell. The black tracery of witch marks across his face, arms, and chest tickled like spider feet. When he thrust his hand into the fire, he didn't feel the heat of it. Straightening, he moved to the far side of the fire and faced the old man. "I'm ready."<br><br>Teolin held the oo'lu upright and chanted the blessing, then tossed it across to Mahti. <br><br>He caught it awkwardly in his fire hand, gripping it well below the center. Even hollow, it was a heavy thing. It nearly overbalanced, and if it had fallen, he'd have had to burn it and start all over again. But he managed to hang on to it, gritting his teeth until the witch marks faded completely from sight on his arms. He took the horn in his left hand and inspected it. The shiny black print of his fire hand was branded into the wood.<br><br>Teolin took it back and carefully examined how the marks of Mahti's splayed fingers intersected the carved designs. He was a long time at it, humming and sucking his gums. <br><br>"What's wrong?" asked Mahti. "Is it a bad luck cycle?"<br><br>"This is the Sojourn mark you've made. You better spit for it." <br><br>Teolin scratched a circle in the ashes at the edge of the fire with his knife. Mahti took a mouthful of water from the gourd and spat forcefully into the circle, then turned away quickly as Teolin hunkered down to interpret the marks. <br><br>The old man sighed. "You'll travel among strangers until this oo'lu cracks. Whether that's good luck or bad, only the Mother knows, and she doesn't feel like telling me tonight. But it's a strong mark you made. You'll travel a long way."<br><br>Mahti bowed respectfully. If Teolin said it would be so, then it would be. Best just to accept it. "When do I go? Will I see Lhamila's child born?"<br><br>Teolin sucked his gums again, staring down at the spit marks. "Go home by a straight path tomorrow and lay your blessings on her belly. A sign will come. But now, let's hear this fine horn I've made for you!"<br><br>Mahti settled his mouth firmly inside the wax mouthpiece. It was still warm and smelled of summer. Closing his eyes, he filled his cheeks with air and blew gently out through loosened lips. <br><br>Sojourn's deep voice came to life with his breath. He hardly had to adjust his playing style at all before the rich, steady drone warmed the wood beneath his hands. Gazing up at the white moon, he sent a silent thanks to the Mother. Whatever his new fate was, he knew already that he would do great magic with Sojourn, surpassing all he'd done with Moon Plow. <br><br>By the time he finished the claiming song he was light-headed. "It's good!" he gasped. "Are you ready?"<br><br>The old man nodded and hobbled back into the hut. <br><br>They'd agreed on the payment their first day together. Mahti lit the bear fat lamp and set it by the piled furs of the sleeping platform. <br><br>Teolin shrugged off his cloak and undid the ties of his shapeless robe. The elk and bear teeth decorating it clicked softly as he let it fall. He stretched out on his pallet, and Mahti knelt and ran his eyes over the old man's body, feeling compassion tinged with sadness rise in his heart. No one knew how old Teolin was, not even the old witch himself. Time had eaten most of the flesh from his frame. His penis, said to have planted more than five hundred festival seeds, now lay like a shrunken thumb against his hairless sac. <br><br>The old man smiled gently. "Do what you can. Neither the Mother nor I ask more than that."<br><br>Mahti leaned down, kissed the old man's lined brow, and drew the fusty bearskin up to Teolin's chin to keep him warm. Settling beside the platform, he rested the end of the horn close to the old man's side, closed his eyes, and began the spell song.<br><br>With lips and tongue and breath, he altered the drone to a sonorous, rhythmic pulse. The sound filled Mahti's head and chest, making his bones shiver. He gathered the energies and sent them out through Sojourn to Teolin. He could feel the song enter the old man, lifting the strong soul free of the frail, pain-wracked body, letting it drift up through the smoke hole like milkweed fluff. Bathing in the light of a full moon was very healing for a soul. It returned to the body cleansed and gave a clear mind and good health.<br><br>Satisfied, Mahti changed the song, tightening his lips to weave in the night croak of a heron, the booming boast of grandfather frog, and the high, reedy chorus of all the little peepers who knew the rain's secrets. With these, he washed the hot sand from the old man's joints and cleansed the little biting spirits from his intestines. Searching deeper, he smelled a shadow in Teolin's chest and followed it to a dark mass in the upper lobe of his liver. The death there was still asleep, curled tight like a child in the womb. This, Mahti could not cleanse away. Some were fated to carry their own deaths. Teolin would understand. For now, at least, there was no pain. <br><br>Mahti let his mind wander on through the old man's body, soothing the old fractures in his right heel and left arm, pressing the pus away from the root of a broken molar, dissolving the grit in the old man's bladder and kidneys. For all its wizened appearance, Teolin's penis was still strong. Mahti played the sound of a forest fire into his sac. The old man had a few more festivals in him; let the Mother be served by another generation bearing his fine old blood.<br><br>The rest was all old scars, long since healed or accepted. Allowing himself a whim, he played the white owl's call through Teolin's long bones, then droned the soul back down into the old man's flesh. <br><br>When he was finished, he was surprised to see pink dawn light shining in through the smoke hole. He was covered in sweat and shaking, but elated. Smoothing his hand down the polished length of the oo'lu, he whispered, "We will do great things, you and I."<br><br>Teolin stirred and opened his eyes. <br><br>"The owl song tells me you are one hundred and eight years old," Mahti informed him. <br><br>The old man chuckled. "Thank you. I'd lost track." He reached out and touched the handprint on the oo'lu. "I caught a vision for you while I slept. I saw the moon, but it was not the Mother's round moon. It was a crescent, sharp as a snake's tooth. I've seen that vision only once before, not too long ago. It was for a witch from Eagle Valley village."<br><br>"Did she learn what it meant?"<br><br>"I don't know. She went away with some oreskiri. I've never heard anything of her return. Her name is Lhel. If you meet her in your travels, give her my greeting. Perhaps she can tell you the meaning."<br><br>"Thank you, I'll do that. But you still don't know if my fate is a good one or a bad one?"<br><br>"I've never walked Sojourn's path. Perhaps it depends on where your feet take you. Walk bravely in your all travels, honor the Mother, and remember who you are. Do that and you will continue to be a good man, and a fine witch."<br>***<br>Mahti left the old man's clearing at dawn the next day, Teolin's blessing still tingling on his brow.<br><br>Plodding over the crusty snow, Sojourn a comforting weight across his shoulders in its sling, he smelled the first hint of spring on the morning air. Later, as the sun rose over the peaks, he heard it in the dripping of water from bare branches. <br><br>He knew this trail well. The rhythmic crunch and rasp of his snowshoes lulled him into a light trance and his thoughts drifted. He wondered if he'd plant different kinds of children now than he had under the Moon Plow sign? Then again, if he were to travel far, would he plant any children at all?<br><br>He wasn't surprised when the vision came. He often had them at moments like these, tramping alone through the peace of the forest.<br><br>The winding path became a river under his feet, and the sinew and bent ash of his snowshoes grew into a little boat that bobbed gently on the current. Instead of the thick forest on the far bank, there was open land, very green and fertile. He knew in the way of visions that this must be the southland, where his people had once lived, before the foreigners and their oreskiri had driven them into the hills.<br><br>A woman stood between a tall man and a young girl on that bank, and she waved to Mahti as if she knew him. She was Retha'noi like him, and naked. Dark-skinned and small, her fine, ripe body was covered with witch marks. The fact that she was naked in the vision told him that she was dead, a spirit coming to him with a message. <br><br><i>Greetings, my brother. I am Lhel. </i><br><br>Mahti's eyes widened as he recognized the name. This was the woman Teolin had spoken of, the one who'd gone away with the southlanders on a sojourn of her own. She smiled at him and he smiled back; this was the Mother's will. <br><br>She beckoned him to join her but his boat would not move. <br><br>He looked more closely at the others with her. They were black-haired, too, but the man's was cut short and the girl's hung in long waves around her shoulders rather than the coarse curls of his people. They were taller, too, and pale as a pair of bones. The young man had an aura of strong magic about him: oreskiri, surely, but with a hint of power Mahti recognized. This witch, Lhel, must have taught him something of their ways. That was troubling, even though Teolin had spoken no ill of her. <br><br>The girl did not have magic, but Lhel pointed to the ground at the girl's feet and Mahti saw that she had a double shadow, one male, and one female. <br><br>He didn't know how to interpret the vision yet, except that these two were both living people, and southlanders. He was not afraid or angry to see them here in his mountains, though. Maybe it was the way the other witch rested her hands on their shoulders, love so clear in her dark eyes. She looked at Mahti again and made a sign of bequeathing. She was giving these two strangers into his care, but why?<br><br>Without thinking, he set the new oo'lu to his lips and played a song he did not recognize. <br><br>The vision passed and the forest path returned around him. He was standing in a clearing, still playing that song. He didn't know what it was for; perhaps it was for the southlanders. He would play it for them when they met and see if they knew.</p><h2>House of X / Powers of X</h2><p>Mutants are the future, and the future begins now!

But the sad fact is that these narratives of suspicion&#x2014;and the delusional psychologies that fuel them&#x2014;have been a constant presence in American life for nearly as long as there&#x2019;s been an America.<br><br> In this sweeping book, Thomas Milan Konda traces the country&#x2019;s obsession with conspiratorial thought from the early days of the republic to our own anxious moment. <i>Conspiracies of Conspiracies</i> details centuries of sinister speculations&#x2014;from antisemitism and anti-Catholicism to UFOs and reptilian humanoids&#x2014;and their often incendiary outcomes. Rather than simply rehashing the surface eccentricities of such theories, Konda draws from his unprecedented assemblage of conspiratorial writing to crack open the mindsets that lead people toward these self-sealing worlds of denial. What is distinctively American about these theories, he argues, is not simply our country&#x2019;s homegrown obsession with them but their ongoing prevalence and virulence. Konda proves that conspiracy theories are no harmless sideshow. They are instead the dark and secret heart of American political history&#x2014;one that is poisoning the bloodstream of an increasingly sick body politic.</p><p><b>Thomas Milan Konda</b> is emeritus professor of political science at SUNY Plattsburgh.&#x201c;The theories Konda weighs and finds wanting are fascinating in their perversity, from chemtrails to climate change deniers. A book that deserves wide circulation and consideration.&#x201d; (<i>Kirkus Reviews</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Offers insightful context for why the United States has become as obsessed with conspiracy theories as it is. . . . By weaving historical literature with contemporary studies, Konda is able to draw clear connections between the past and the present. . . . His objective and academic approach ultimately demystifies elements of alt-right media that, for many, seemed to come out of nowhere during the 2016 presidential election.&#x201d; (<i>Ploughshares</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Incisive and engaging. . .&nbsp;&nbsp;Konda's assessment of the &#x201c;new dynamics&#x201d; of conspiracy theories in contemporary US politics is a significant contribution.&nbsp;Written with a clarity of expression rare in academic writing, the book is accessible to a wide readership. . . . Highly recommended.&#x201d; (<i>Choice</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;<i>Conspiracies of Conspiracies</i>&nbsp;is clearly written and deeply researched, a fine-grained account of American conspiracism from the earliest years of the Republic to the present day. There is scarcely a manifestation that Konda has omitted, and periods that others have merely sketched out are presented here in a detail that can be found in few other places. The times being what they are, the subject is (alas!) likely to remain of interest for many years to come." (Michael Barkun <i>author of A Culture of Conspiracy: Apocalyptic Visions in Contemporary America</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;Bridging the divide between quantitative and qualitative approaches to the topic, Konda provides a comprehensive overview of the cultural and political work that conspiracy theories have done in the United States over the past two hundred years. He explains why these theories have recently made a comeback on the political stage and dissects a media landscape that increasingly tends to detect conspiracism everywhere.&#x201d; (Michael Butter <i>author of Plots, Designs, and Schemes: American Conspiracy Theories from the Puritans to the Present</i>)<br><br>&#x201c;There is plenty to be discovered here. . . Konda&#x2019;s survey is perhaps the most comprehensive attempt yet to record and understand&nbsp;the phenomenon of conspiracy theory as it applies to American politics. . .&nbsp;You won&#x2019;t find a catalog of mad musings in <i>Conspiracies of Conspiracies</i>; it&#x2019;s largely a sober and reflective book (although Konda exercises a sly, dry humor on occasion) on a subject that is increasingly contentious, and increasingly central, in&nbsp;the discourses on American politics, science and medicine in particular. . . . Konda manages to give a clear picture of a subject that is more often obscured under a deluge of intensely partisan opinions.&#x201d; (<i>Fortean Times</i>)</p><h2>Case in Point 9: Complete Case Interview Preparation</h2><p>The Wall Street Journal calls Case in Point the MBA Bible!

Their home. My Hell.</p><p>I&#x2019;m Raine Benares. An elven seeker whose job used to be finding lost things and missing people, usually in nice, safe places like prisons and war zones. Now, thanks to a run&#x2013;in with a soul&#x2013;sucking rock looking for someone to call home, the entire world was about to turn into a war zone, and yours truly was the epicenter.</p><p>Yesterday the world&#x2013;ending stone known as the Saghred had been stolen. I called it several other names not repeatable in public. The thing had attached itself to me and magnified my magic; and even now that it was thousands of miles away, we were still bonded. The goblin who had ordered it stolen needed me dead to break that bond and transfer control of the rock and all of its power to himself. To stand a snowball&#x2019;s chance in hell (excuse me, Tam&#x2019;s home) of destroying the rock, I needed to stay very much alive.</p><p>Hence my dilemma&#x2014;save the world or die a slow and painful death. Though I couldn&#x2019;t exactly call my situation a dilemma. A dilemma implied you had a choice. If it was up to me, somebody else could save the world; I&#x2019;d just rather keep breathing. However, if I managed by some major miracle to do both, I wanted to be properly dressed for it. Head&#x2013;to&#x2013;toe steel surrounded by a platoon of Conclave Guardians should do the trick. Some people would call that paranoid; I called it barely adequate accessorizing.</p><p>But I wouldn&#x2019;t have a platoon, and head&#x2013;to&#x2013;toe steel would make running away more of a challenge than I was up for. I was armored, both leather and steel, enough for protection, but without impeding any sudden need to retreat. Less than a dozen of us would be sneaking into Regor, stealing the Saghred, destroying it in a way that would hopefully not do the same to me, and getting back to Mid with the same pieces and parts that we left with.</p><p>A handful of us against the might of the goblin king, the goblin army, and probably some absurdly huge demons who owed them all favors. Oh yeah, and one soul&#x2013;hungry rock.</p><p>And how could I forget an all&#x2013;powerful, fledgling goblin demigod by the name of Sarad Nukpana?</p><p>Survival would take a miracle.</p><p>Especially since I didn&#x2019;t have a lick of magic to my name.</p><p>The Saghred had stolen my magic, then the goblins had stolen the stone.</p><p>It sucked to be me right now.</p><p>I was going to where my worst enemy was and I had no magic. Well, that wasn&#x2019;t exactly true. I had a spark, and if I held it against a wick long enough, I might just be able to light a candle. Sarad Nukpana was constructing, and about to open, a Gate big enough for an army to go through, a hundred goblins at a time&#x2014;and doing every last bit of it with magic. He could teleport an army, and right now I&#x2019;d work up a sweat lighting a candle. We&#x2019;d love to be able to destroy the Saghred <i>and</i> the Gate, but our first priority was the rock.</p><p>The plan was simple&#x2014;or simply suicide. Nukpana had the Saghred, but we still had the Scythe of Nen. Literally eons ago, the demon king had it forged so he could cut into the Saghred like an oyster and slurp up the souls inside. In theory, the Saghred could be destroyed if it was first emptied of souls. It was a logical solution, but this was a soul&#x2013;snatching rock that had kept itself intact through the ages by making its own logic and luck. And it wasn&#x2019;t exactly a solution, or even a good idea, to let the souls out. Most of them hadn&#x2019;t been nice people to begin with; in fact, a lot of them could give Sarad Nukpana competition in the evil megalomaniac department.</p><p>While some would want nothing more than to float off to their great reward. Others&#x2014;powerful and evil others&#x2014;would infest and possess the first bodies they could take. That presented two problems. One, they could possess us; the problem there being obvious. Two, they could possess any Khrynsani in the immediate vicinity of the high altar. That would be Sarad Nukpana and his craziest and most powerful black mage allies. Evil plus evil equals extremely undesirable.</p><p>The world had enough problems without <i>that</i> happening.</p><p>Unfortunately, even if Sarad Nukpana gave us a clear path to the Saghred, we still needed the help of one goblin in Regor to keep those souls from infesting and possessing&#x2014;Kesyn Badru, Tam&#x2019;s first magic teacher, the man who tried to prevent Tam from running down magic&#x2019;s dark path to do the things an entirely&#x2013;too&#x2013;powerful young mage had no business doing. Tam had been more like his teenage son, Talon than he&#x2019;d care to admit, and had successfully destroyed anything resembling a relationship with his teacher. For all we knew, when we found him, Kesyn Badru might try to turn Tam into something squishy on sight or simply kill him. From what I&#x2019;d heard about Tam&#x2019;s youthful indiscretions, I really wouldn&#x2019;t blame Kesyn Badru in the least.</p><p>The way things were stacking up, Sarad Nukpana might be easier to deal with.</p><p>Kesyn Badru was an expert on Reapers. Reapers basically worked for Death, gathering wayward souls and taking them to where they needed to go next. When we opened the Saghred, we needed plenty of Reapers standing by for the cleanup of any souls who refused to move along nicely.</p><p>Bottom line, slicing into the Saghred with the Scythe of Nen and letting the souls inside go free could make it possible for us to destroy the stone.</p><p>Or not.</p><p>And since I was bound to the Saghred, the Reapers we needed to collect the souls might collect me, too.</p><p>Or not.</p><p>Yesterday Sarad Nukpana&#x2019;s thief had forced our hand. We had no choice but to try to do all of the above. And if it let me&#x2014;or Mychael, if I wasn&#x2019;t alive to do it myself&#x2014;smash the thing into a million pieces, it would be worth it. Simply stealing the Saghred back was no longer an option. Sarad Nukpana had to be stopped, and whatever I had to do would be worth it.</p><p>If I died, I would have died to save millions from torment, slavery, or death at Sarad Nukpana&#x2019;s hands. I&#x2019;d been telling myself all night that it&#x2019;d be a good and noble death.</p><p>I&#x2019;d never been more terrified in my life. I was almost sick with it.</p><p>There were easier and certainly less painful ways to commit suicide. The only upside to this whole thing was that we&#x2019;d be leaving for Regor within the hour. That didn&#x2019;t leave much time for me to imagine all the ways Sarad Nukpana, the Saghred, or the Reapers could kill me. The less time I had to ponder any of those, the better.</p><p>Leaving here within the hour, and arriving in Regor seconds after that.</p><p>I despised mirror magic, but I had to admit that it was a damned efficient way to get from one place to another.</p><p>To tell you the truth, I was scared to death of it. Partly because I didn&#x2019;t understand how the finer points of the art worked. Stepping into one mirror and instantly walking out of another one hundreds or even thousands of miles away sure as hell wasn&#x2019;t a parlor trick&#x2014;and mirror mages knew it. Superior to everyone else was how the best of them saw themselves; though most felt that simple worship would suffice. I&#x2019;d never met a humble mirror mage.</p><p>I did a last check of the pack I was taking with me. More weapons than anything else, small and easily concealed. What couldn&#x2019;t be hidden was already strapped to me. I wasn&#x2019;t taking much by way of clothes&#x2014;one change of everything in case what I was wearing picked up a couple of unsightly bloodstains or sword slashes. It&#x2019;d been my experience that running for your life was best done while carrying as little extraneous weight as possible.</p><p>I slung my small pack over my shoulder and opened the door.</p><p>Standing there, hand raised to knock, was one of the last people I expected.</p><p>Piaras Rivalin.</p><p>He was a tall young elf, with big brown eyes and dark brown curls that would have made him look perfectly at home painted on the ceiling of some fancy chapel. To the pair of Guardians posted outside my door, Piaras was an eighteen&#x2013;year&#x2013;old cadet in their order. To me he was the little brother I&#x2019;d never had, but always wanted.</p><p>I&#x2019;d known Piaras since he was twelve. The self&#x2013;possessed young man standing in front of me had grown up fast over a too short period of time. No one had given him a choice, either. For the two of us, the past three months had been one deal&#x2013;with&#x2013;it&#x2013;or&#x2013;die moment right after another. Piaras had faced and fought things that would have sent most kids his age scrambling under their beds. To make it even worse, he was in nearly as much danger from Sarad Nukpana as I was. The bastard knew how much I loved Piaras; knew it and wouldn&#x2019;t hesitate to use him to get to me.</p><p>Piaras&#x2019;s dream had been to become a Guardian and here he was in the uniform and armor of a cadet. In my opinion, he should have been on one of the ships trying to evacuate the other students from the island before the goblins invaded.</p><p>I stared up at him. &#x201c;Come to see me off before you get your butt on an evac ship?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Yes and no.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;&#x2019;Yes&#x2019; you&#x2019;re getting on that ship, and &#x2019;no&#x2019; you&#x2019;re not here to see me off, right?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Reverse them.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Dammit, Piaras. I&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Paladin Eiliesor gave us all the choice. I chose to stay.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You should be on a ship.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m needed here.&#x201d;</p><p>From most kids his age, those words would come off sounding stubborn. From Piaras, it was steadfast and decisive. I knew I wouldn&#x2019;t be able to change his mind, but if he wasn&#x2019;t going to be stubborn, I would.</p><p>I lowered my voice. &#x201c;And <i>I</i> need you alive. While I&#x2019;m in Regor I need to know you&#x2019;re safe.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Raine, I&#x2019;ve already reported for duty&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Then un&#x2013;report.&#x201d; The vehemence in my voice surprised even me.</p><p>&#x201c;You&#x2019;re not un&#x2013;reporting.&#x201d; There was no accusation in his voice; he was simply stating a fact.</p><p>&#x201c;Regor is the last place I want to go, but I don&#x2019;t have a choice. You do.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;You have a choice,&#x201d; Piaras said. &#x201c;You&#x2019;re going because you couldn&#x2019;t live with yourself if you didn&#x2019;t go. You know you can help, so that&#x2019;s what you&#x2019;re going to do. Same with me. What I&#x2019;d really like is to hide under my bed in the barracks, close my eyes, and have every last bit of this crap go away. But that&#x2019;s not going to happen, so here I am.&#x201d;</p><p>I glared at him. &#x201c;You know you&#x2019;re too young to be this smart, don&#x2019;t you?&#x201d;</p><p>Piaras flashed a smile that was probably making the coeds swoon. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s a burden I bear.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I&#x2019;m sure I don&#x2019;t want to know, but where are they sending you?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Here.&#x201d;</p><p>I blinked. &#x201c;What?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Sir Vegard ordered me to take his place as your bodyguard&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>As my bodyguard, Vegard Rolfgar had been shot, tortured, and attacked by demons; damned near dying from all of the above. He&#x2019;d wanted to go with us to Regor, but Mychael had made him acting paladin instead and put him in charge of the evacuation.</p><p>With a life of their own, my fists went to my hips. &#x201c;You are <i>not</i> going to Regor. I don&#x2019;t care who&#x2014;&#x201d;</p><p>Piaras grinned and held up a hand. &#x201c;Vegard wants me to see you safely to the mirror room and then report back to him.&#x201d; He stopped and half winced, the sudden embarrassment in his big eyes making him look like that awkward twelve&#x2013;year&#x2013;old again. &#x201c;He ordered me to do one other thing.&#x201d;</p><p>I narrowed my eyes. &#x201c;And what is that?&#x201d; Vegard was about to get more trouble from me than he&#x2019;d have from any invading goblin army.</p><p>Piaras stepped forward. &#x201c;Uh . . . he told me to give you this.&#x201d;</p><p>Piaras hugged me. Hard. My feet left the floor somewhere in the process. I should&#x2019;ve been grateful that Vegard had Piaras stand&#x2013;in for him; a hug like that from Vegard probably would&#x2019;ve cracked a couple of my ribs. When Piaras showed no signs of letting go, I suddenly realized that hug wasn&#x2019;t just from Vegard. I wrapped my arms around Piaras&#x2019;s neck; my face buried against his shoulder and fiercely returned his hug. If I didn&#x2019;t make it back, this could be the last time I&#x2019;d ever see him. My eyes swam with sudden tears.</p><p>Piaras started to put me down.</p><p>&#x201c;No, no. Wait.&#x201d; I sniffed and tried for a smile. &#x201c;I have something for . . . Vegard, too. Give him this.&#x201d; I grabbed both sides of Piaras&#x2019;s head and planted a big kiss on his forehead, and then hugged him again. That wasn&#x2019;t just for Vegard, either.</p><p>The Guardians behind us snickered.</p><p>Piaras blushed to the tips of his pointed ears. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll just tell him about it, if you don&#x2019;t mind.&#x201d; He picked up my pack where I&#x2019;d dropped it to hug him. &#x201c;I&#x2019;ll get this.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Thank you.&#x201d; I&#x2019;d be carrying it myself soon enough, and who knew for how long, so I&#x2019;d take help now while I could get it.</p><p>Every Guardian we passed on our way to the mirror room had somewhere to go and was moving fast. Either that or they were already there and standing guard. To a man, they had one thing in common&#x2014;the same grim and determined expression. I didn&#x2019;t know what was behind some of the doors being guarded, but I almost felt sorry for anyone who tried to find out.</p><p>I had to move just as fast to keep up with Piaras&#x2019;s long strides. &#x201c;After seeing me to the mirror room, what next?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Pardon?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Your orders. What are they?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Once you&#x2019;re all safely through, I guard that mirror until you come back.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Guard?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;If anyone tries to get into the mirror room who doesn&#x2019;t belong, they&#x2019;ll be taking a long nap and waking up in a small cell.&#x201d;</p><p>Piaras could do it; I had no doubt&#x2014;and neither did any of the hundred or so Guardians he&#x2019;d accidently put to sleep after he&#x2019;d only been here a few days. Piaras was a spellsinger, probably the best of his generation. His voice was a deep, rich baritone&#x2014;and a weapon. As far as magical skills went, spellsinging wasn&#x2019;t all that rare, but Piaras&#x2019;s level of skill was. Rare, powerful, and deadly.</p><p>I had a thought I didn&#x2019;t like, but it was a possibility, a very unpleasant one.</p><p>&#x201c;What if someone comes back through our mirror besides us?&#x201d;</p><p>Piaras gave me a grim smile that he should have been too young to have. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re equal opportunity sleep&#x2013;inducers.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;We?&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Maestro Cayle will be standing guard with me.&#x201d;</p><p>I experienced a short, but oh&#x2013;so&#x2013;welcome, moment of relief. I hadn&#x2019;t had many of those lately so I enjoyed it while I could. Maestro Ronan Cayle was the best spellsinger there was. If anyone&#x2019;s ass needed kicking&#x2014;mage, mundane, or demon&#x2014;Ronan was the man to serve it up. He was also Piaras&#x2019;s spellsinging teacher. If Piaras wouldn&#x2019;t leave the island on an evac ship, knowing that Ronan would be with him was a comfort I&#x2019;d gladly take.</p><p>&#x201c;Is Talon staying, too?&#x201d;</p><p>Piaras blew out his breath. &#x201c;Oh yeah.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;I understand he and Tam had quite the throwdown about that.&#x201d;</p><p>&#x201c;Heard by half the citadel.&#x201d;</p><p>Talon Nathrach was Tam&#x2019;s son. As former chief mage and magical enforcer to the goblin royal House of Mal&#x2019;Salin, Tam was part of the team going to Regor. Talon&#x2019;s mother had been an elf, which made Talon a half&#x2013;breed, an abomination to both old&#x2013;blood elves and goblins. The goblin court in Regor was packed to the walls with old&#x2013;blood goblin aristocrats. From what I&#x2019;d heard, they&#x2019;d kill Talon on sight.</p><p>Talon becoming a Guardian cadet was Tam&#x2019;s effort to teach his impulsive son responsibility, respect, and above all, control. I told Tam he shouldn&#x2019;t hold his breath.</p><p>&#x201c;You can&#x2019;t exactly blame Talon,&#x201d; I said. &#x201c;He just fo...</p></p><h2>Shade: Planting Solutions for Shady Gardens</h2><p><p>Every garden has some shade&#x2014;some gardens are even completely shaded&#x2014;and gardeners tend to see shade as a problem.

In the program of the broadest education of the races and the promotion of social concord and co-operation this volume should be in every library and home of the country.

To remain true in the work of ministry we must have Spirit-inspired and unshakable biblical convictions. The apostle Paul braved the worst of storms in his years of fruitful ministry.

I am so glad that John MacArthur, a faithful minister of the Word of God for five decades, has taken the time to write about what it takes to be consistent in the pulpit and in life from beginning to end. This book is biblically solid, well written, easy to read, deep, engaging, inspiring, brief, and built on the faithful legacy of the apostle Paul.

In this little book, John MacArthur does just that. He examines the life of the apostle Paul, encouraging and challenging pastors to follow Paul as he followed Christ. For elders, seminary students, and pastors of all ages, this is a book for those men who are biblically qualified to shepherd the flock of God and proclaim the Word of God in season and out of season for the glory of God alone.&#x201d;<br>&#x2015;<strong>Burk Parsons</strong><strong>,</strong>&nbsp;Senior Pastor, St. Andrew&#x2019;s Chapel, Sanford, Florida; Editor, <em>Tabletalk</em></p><p>&#x201c;This book could save many ministries, so I pray every church gets a copy of <i>Remaining Faithful in Ministry</i> for their pastor.

This book describes a new way of using perennials in parks and gardens based on ecological rather then purely aesthetic principles. It demonstrates how attention to ecological needs of herbaceous perennials can result in low maintenance plantings in parks and other public spaces. The entire field of ornamental perennials is described with the main emphasis upon the ecological nature of the plant rather than the usual height, flowering sense and colour descriptions.

Today his name is synonymous with the epic battles of ancient times, but Conan originated in the early decades of the twentieth century with one of the founding fathers of fantasy, the visionary Robert E. Howard. The unforgettable stories collected here form a thrilling adventure, following Conan from his mercenary youth to his bloody conquests on the frontier and even the high seas. Bold and enduring, the legend of Conan the Barbarian continues to grow in popularity and influence.</p><p><b>Robert E. Howard</b> is one of the most prolific short story writers in American history, and has created such beloved characters as Conan the Barbarian, Kull of Atlantis, Soloman Kane, Bran Mak Morn, El Borak, and Dark Agn�s de Chastillon. He tragically passed away in 1936.The Phoenix on the Sword<br><br>I<br><br>"Know, oh prince, that between the years when the oceans drank Atlantis and the gleaming cities, and the years of the rise of the Sons of Aryas, there was an Age undreamed of, when shining kingdoms lay spread across the world like blue mantles beneath the stars - Nemedia, Ophir, Brythunia, Hyperborea, Zamora with its dark-haired women and towers of spider-haunted mystery, Zingara with its chivalry, Koth that bordered on the pastoral lands of Shem, Stygia with its shadow-guarded tombs, Hyrkania whose riders wore steel and silk and gold. But the proudest kingdom of the world was Aquilonia, reigning supreme in the dreaming west. Hither came Conan, the Cimmerian, black-haired, sullen-eyed, sword in hand, a thief, a reaver, a slayer, with gigantic melancholies and gigantic mirth, to tread the jeweled thrones of the Earth under his sandalled feet."<br><br>- The Nemedian Chronicles.<br><br>Over shadowy spires and gleaming towers lay the ghostly darkness and silence that runs before dawn. Into a dim alley, one of a veritable labyrinth of mysterious winding ways, four masked figures came hurriedly from a door which a dusky hand furtively opened. They spoke not but went swiftly into the gloom, cloaks wrapped closely about them; as silently as the ghosts of murdered men they disappeared in the darkness. Behind them a sardonic countenance was framed in the partly opened door; a pair of evil eyes glittered malevolently in the gloom.<br><br>"Go into the night, creatures of the night," a voice mocked. "Oh, fools, your doom hounds your heels like a blind dog, and you know it not."<br><br>The speaker closed the door and bolted it, then turned and went up the corridor, candle in hand. He was a somber giant, whose dusky skin revealed his Stygian blood. He came into an inner chamber, where a tall, lean man in worn velvet lounged like a great lazy cat on a silken couch, sipping wine from a huge golden goblet.<br><br>"Well, Ascalante," said the Stygian, setting down the candle, "your dupes have slunk into the streets like rats from their burrows. You work with strange tools."<br><br>"Tools?" replied Ascalante. "Why, they consider me that. For months now, ever since the Rebel Four summoned me from the southern desert, I have been living in the very heart of my enemies, hiding by day in this obscure house, skulking through dark alleys and darker corridors at night. And I have accomplished what those rebellious nobles could not. Working through them, and through other agents, many of whom have never seen my face, I have honeycombed the empire with sedition and unrest. In short I, working in the shadows, have paved the downfall of the king who sits throned in the sun. By Mitra, I was a statesman before I was an outlaw."<br><br>"And these dupes who deem themselves your masters?"<br><br>"They will continue to think that I serve them, until our present task is completed. Who are they to match wits with Ascalante? Volmana, the dwarfish count of Karaban; Gromel, the giant commander of the Black Legion; Dion, the fat baron of Attalus; Rinaldo, the hare-brained minstrel. I am the force which has welded together the steel in each, and by the clay in each, I will crush them when the time comes. But that lies in the future; tonight the king dies."<br><br>"Days ago I saw the imperial squadrons ride from the city," said the Stygian.<br><br>"They rode to the frontier which the heathen Picts assail - thanks to the strong liquor which I've smuggled over the borders to madden them. Dion's great wealth made that possible. And Volmana made it possible to dispose of the rest of the imperial troops which remained in the city. Through his princely kin in Nemedia, it was easy to persuade King Numa to request the presence of Count Trocero of Poitain, seneschal of Aquilonia; and of course, to do him honor, he'll be accompanied by an imperial escort, as well as his own troops, and Prospero, King Conan's right-hand man. That leaves only the king's personal bodyguard in the city-besides the Black Legion. Through Gromel I've corrupted a spendthrift officer of that guard, and bribed him to lead his men away from the king's door at midnight.<br><br>"Then, with sixteen desperate rogues of mine, we enter the palace by a secret tunnel. After the deed is done, even if the people do not rise to welcome us, Gromel's Black Legion will be sufficient to hold the city and the crown."<br><br>"And Dion thinks that crown will be given to him?"<br><br>"Yes. The fat fool claims it by reason of a trace of royal blood. Conan makes a bad mistake in letting men live who still boast descent from the old dynasty, from which he tore the crown of Aquilonia.<br><br>"Volmana wishes to be reinstated in royal favor as he was under the old regime, so that he may lift his poverty-ridden estates to their former grandeur. Gromel hates Pallantides, commander of the Black Dragons, and desires the command of the whole army, with all the stubbornness of the Bossonian. Alone of us all, Rinaldo has no personal ambition. He sees in Conan a red-handed, rough-footed barbarian who came out of the north to plunder a civilized land. He idealizes the king whom Conan killed to get the crown, remembering only that he occasionally patronized the arts, and forgetting the evils of his reign, and he is making the people forget. Already they openly sing The Lament for the King in which Rinaldo lauds the sainted villain and denounces Conan as 'that black-hearted savage from the abyss.' Conan laughs, but the people snarl."<br><br>"Why does he hate Conan?"<br><br>"Poets always hate those in power. To them perfection is always just behind the last corner, or beyond the next. They escape the present in dreams of the past and future. Rinaldo is a flaming torch of idealism, rising, as he thinks, to overthrow a tyrant and liberate the people. As for me - well, a few months ago I had lost all ambition but to raid the caravans for the rest of my life; now old dreams stir. Conan will die; Dion will mount the throne. Then he, too, will die. One by one, all who oppose me will die - by fire, or steel, or those deadly wines you know so well how to brew. Ascalante, king of Aquilonia! How like you the sound of it?"<br><br>The Stygian shrugged his broad shoulders.<br><br>"There was a time," he said with unconcealed bitterness, "when I, too, had my ambitions, beside which yours seem tawdry and childish. To what a state I have fallen! My old-time peers and rivals would stare indeed could they see Thoth-amon of the Ring serving as the slave of an outlander, and an outlaw at that; and aiding in the petty ambitions of barons and kings!"<br><br>"You laid your trust in magic and mummery," answered Ascalante carelessly. "I trust my wits and my sword."<br><br>"Wits and swords are as straws against the wisdom of the Darkness," growled the Stygian, his dark eyes flickering with menacing lights and shadows. "Had I not lost the Ring, our positions might be reversed."<br><br>"Nevertheless," answered the outlaw impatiently, "you wear the stripes of my whip on your back, and are likely to continue to wear them."<br><br>"Be not so sure!" The fiendish hatred of the Stygian glittered for an instant redly in his eyes. "Some day, somehow, I will find the Ring again, and when I do, by the serpent-fangs of Set, you shall pay -"<br><br>The hot-tempered Aquilonian started up and struck him heavily across the mouth. Thoth reeled back, blood starting from his lips.<br><br>"You grow over-bold, dog," growled the outlaw. "Have a care; I am still your master who knows your dark secret. Go upon the house-tops and shout that Ascalante is in the city plotting against the king - if you dare."<br><br>"I dare not," muttered the Stygian, wiping the blood from his lips.<br><br>"No, you do not dare," Ascalante grinned bleakly. "For if I die by your stealth or treachery, a hermit priest in the southern desert will know of it, and will break the seal of a manuscript I left in his hands. And having read, a word will be whispered in Stygia, and a wind will creep up from the south by midnight. And where will you hide your head, Thoth-amon?"<br><br>The slave shuddered and his dusky face went ashen.<br><br>"Enough!" Ascalante changed his tone peremptorily. "I have work for you. I do not trust Dion. I bade him ride to his country estate and remain there until the work tonight is done. The fat fool could never conceal his nervousness before the king today. Ride after him, and if you do not overtake him on the road, proceed to his estate and remain with him until we send for him. Don't let him out of your sight. He is mazed with fear, and might bolt - might even rush to Conan in a panic, and reveal the whole plot, hoping thus to save his own hide. Go!"<br><br>The slave bowed, hiding the hate in his eyes, and did as he was bidden. Ascalante turned again to his wine. Over the jeweled spires was rising a dawn crimson as blood.</p><h2>The Painter in Oil</h2><p>A widely cited resource on painting in the style of the old masters, this classic guide contains a wealth of insights for amateur and professional artists.

Talbot provides insight into</p><p>Ian Talbot is Senior Lecturer in History at Coventry University.Coventry University historian Talbot piles fact upon grim fact to show how Pakistan, born in suffering, has yet to heal the wounds of its past. The woes of this strategically located country seem overwhelming: rapid urbanization and population growth; high infant mortality and low literacy; unfavorable balance of payments; an economy skewed toward military spending; environmental pollution; refugee problems; and violence related to the trafficking of drugs and arms. Islam, with its various flavors, has provided "insufficient cement" for building a nation out of warring ethnic, linguistic and regional factions. Added to all this is the country's perennial conflict with India, and the nuclear competition darkening the horizon. Talbot expresses faith in the courage and resilience of the Pakistani people, but his account of authoritarian regimes, chaotic elections and failed efforts at reform is at odds with his hopes for participatory democracy.

For the past forty years her presence has been radically minimized. In a groundbreaking work, Charlene Spretnak cuts across the battle lines delineated by the left and the right within the Church to champion the recovery of the full spiritual presence of Mary. Spretnak, a liberal Catholic, asserts that a deep loss ensues for women in particular when Mary&#39;s female embodiment of grace and mystical presence is denied and replaced with a strictly text-bound version of her as a Nazarene housewife. Complete with a striking insert of contemporary Marian art, Missing Mary is a deeply insightful reflection on Mary in the modern age.</p><p>Was Vatican II right to downgrade the Virgin Mary? This fall marks the fortieth anniversary of the final session of Vatican II (1962-65) at which the Roman Catholic Church brought itself &#34;up to date&#34;--and, asserts Spretnak, fired the Virgin Mary as Queen of Heaven, demoting her to being &#34;just like us,&#34; merely the first Christian. Spretnak, a liberal Catholic who agrees with 95% of Vatican II&#39;s decisions, cuts across the battle lines of a polarized American Catholic Church, challenging Catholic progressives not to acquiesce to the Catholic Right&#39;s claiming of the Virgin Mary as emblematic of their political positions. This is a book about religion and modernity that has reframed the thinking about Mary in our times.<b>Charlene Spretnak</b> is the author of several books including S<i>tates of Grace </i>and <i>The Resurgence of the Real</i>.

Crowded together with students for six or more hours a day in a space no bigger than a large living room, the immediate response of most teachers is to maintain control and enforce obedience. But creating a community - bringing students together and keeping them together - is the most vital aspect of a teacher's work. Without it, real learning cannot take place, as even the soundest philosophies and techniques amount to little without a community to bring them to life. The concept of community in the classroom is certainly not new, but little has been said about what makes up a community, how it is created, and what functions it fulfills. </p><p>In <i>Life in a Crowded Place</i>, Ralph Peterson helps teachers see what it is they do when they bring students together to make a community.

He looked at the luminous<br> dial of his watch, hanging on its nail. &#x201c;A quarter to six,&#x201d; he<br> mumbled, &#x201c;it&#x2019;s still night.&#x201d; He rubbed his face. &#x201c;What a horrible<br> dream,&#x201d; he thought. &#x201c;What was it again?&#x201d; Gradually it came<br> back to him. He had dreamt that the living room was full of<br> visitors. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to be a glorious weekend,&#x201d; someone said.<br> At that same moment a man in a bowler hat walked in. No<br> one paid him any heed and no one greeted him, but Frits eyed<br> him closely. Suddenly the visitor fell to the floor with a thud.<br> &#x201c;Was that it?&#x201d; he thought. &#x201c;What happened after that?<br> Nothing, I believe.&#x201d; He fell asleep again. The dream went on<br> where it had stopped. His bowler pressed down over his face,<br> the man was now lying in a black coffin that had been placed on<br> a low table in one corner of the room. &#x201c;I don&#x2019;t recognize that<br> table,&#x201d; Frits thought. &#x201c;Did we borrow it from someone?&#x201d; Then,<br> peering into the coffin, he said loudly: &#x201c;We&#x2019;ll be stuck with this<br> till Monday, in any event.&#x201d; &#x201c;I wouldn&#x2019;t be so sure about that,&#x201d;<br> said a bald, red-faced man with spectacles. &#x201c;Would you care to<br> wager that I can arrange the funeral for this afternoon at two?&#x201d;<br>Frits awoke once more.

Music, that always helps.&#x201d; He leaned<br> across the coffin to turn on the radio, but at that same moment<br> saw the hand, bluish now and with long white nails, begin to stir.<br> He recoiled in fear. &#x201c;I mustn&#x2019;t move,&#x201d; he thought, &#x201c;otherwise<br> it will happen.&#x201d; The hand sank back down.<br> Later he awoke, feeling anxious. &#x201c;Ten to seven,&#x201d; he mumbled,<br> peering at the watch. &#x201c;I always have such horrible dreams.&#x201d; He<br> rolled over and fell asleep again.<br> Parting a pair of thick green curtains, he entered the living<br> room. The visitors had returned. The man with the red face<br> came up to him, smiled and said: &#x201c;It didn&#x2019;t work out. It will<br> have to be Monday morning, at ten. We can put the box in the<br> study till then.&#x201d; &#x201c;Study?&#x201d; Frits thought. &#x201c;What study? Do we<br> have a study? He means the side room, of course.&#x201d; Six men<br> lifted the coffin to their shoulders. He himself walked out in<br> front, to open the door for them. &#x201c;The key&#x2019;s still in the lock,&#x201d;<br> he thought, &#x201c;good thing, too.&#x201d;<br>The coffin was extremely heavy; the bearers moved slowly,<br> with measured strides. Suddenly he saw that the bottom of the<br> box was beginning to sag and swell. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s going to burst,&#x201d; he<br> thought, &#x201c;that&#x2019;s hideous. The corpse is still intact on the outside,<br> but inside it&#x2019;s a thin, yellow mush. It will splatter all over the floor.&#x201d;<br> By the time they were halfway down the hall, the bottom<br> was sagging so badly that it had begun to crack. Slowly, out of<br> that crack, appeared the same hand from which he had recoiled.<br> Gradually the whole arm followed. The fingers groped about,<br> then crept towards the throat of one of the bearers. &#x201c;If I scream,<br> the whole thing will fall to the floor,&#x201d; Frits thought. He watched<br> as the bottom sagged further and further and the hand drew<br> closer and closer to the bearer&#x2019;s throat. &#x201c;There&#x2019;s nothing I can<br> do,&#x201d; he thought. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t do a thing.&#x201d;<br> He awakened for the fourth time, and sat up in bed. It was<br> seven thirty-five. The bedroom was cold. He sat there for five<br> minutes, then stood up and, turning on the light, saw the windowpanes<br> covered in flowers of frost. He shivered as he made<br> his way to the toilet.<br> &#x201c;I should start going out for a little walk in the evening, before<br> bed,&#x201d; he thought while washing himself at the kitchen sink. &#x201c;It<br> would make me sleep more soundly.&#x201d; The soap slipped through<br> his fingers, and he spent quite some time feeling around for it in<br> the shadowy space beneath the counter. &#x201c;We&#x2019;re off to a roaring<br> start,&#x201d; he mumbled.<br> &#x201c;But today&#x2019;s Sunday,&#x201d; he realized suddenly, &#x201c;what a piece<br> of luck.&#x201d; Then he added to himself: &#x201c;I&#x2019;m up far too early, how<br> stupid of me. But no, for once my day won&#x2019;t be ruined by lying<br>around till eleven.&#x201d; While drying his face he started to hum,<br> then went into his room, dressed, and combed his hair in the<br> little mirror that hung beside the door, above one corner of the<br> bed. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s ridiculously early,&#x201d; he thought. &#x201c;I can&#x2019;t go in yet. The<br> sliding doors are still open.&#x201d;<br> He sat down at his little desk, picked up a white marble rabbit<br> about the size of a matchbox and tapped it softly against the<br> arm of the chair. Then he put it on top of the pile of papers<br> from whence it came. Standing up with a shiver, he returned to<br> the kitchen, opened the bread bin and took out two soft white<br> rolls, the first of which he stuffed into his mouth in a few bites.<br> The second he held clenched in his teeth as he went into the<br> hallway for his coat.<br> &#x201c;A brisk, invigorating walk in the morning air,&#x201d; he murmured.<br> As he crossed the landing and passed the downstairs neighbours&#x2019;<br> door, a dog yapped. He pulled the street door closed behind him<br> quietly and followed the frozen canal to the river, which was<br> covered along both banks with a dark layer of ice. There was<br> not much wind. The sun had barely risen, but the street lights<br> were already out. The gutters of the houses were lined with rows<br> of gulls. After kneading the last of his roll into a little ball, he<br> tossed it onto the ice and scores of birds descended. The first<br> gull that picked at it missed. The piece of bread slid, fell into a<br> little hole in the ice and sank before another bird could peck at it.<br> Church bells rang once. &#x201c;An early start, this will be a day<br> well spent,&#x201d; he thought, turning right along the riverbank. &#x201c;It&#x2019;s<br> cold and early and no one&#x2019;s out yet, but I am.&#x201d;</p><h2>Organizational Behavior and Management in Law Enforcement (3rd Edition)</h2><p><p>This book provides a clear, concise, realistic, and up-to-date blueprint for successful police management.

It is not only for professional philosophers, but for those engaged in what Deleuze called the "nonphilosophical understanding of philosophy" in other domains, such as the arts, architecture, design, urbanism, new technologies, and politics. For Deleuze's philosophy is meant to go off in many directions at once, opening up zones of unforeseen connections between disciplines.</p><p>Rajchman isolates the logic at the heart of Deleuze's philosophy and the "image of thought" that it supposes. He then works out its implications for social and cultural thought, as well as for art and design&#x2015;for how to do critical theory today. In this way he clarifies the aims and assumptions of a philosophy that looks constantly to invent new ways to affirm the "free differences" and the "complex repetitions" in the histories and spaces in which we find ourselves. He looks at the particular realism and empiricism that this affirmation implies and how they might be used to diagnose new forces confronting us today. In the process, he explores the many connections that Deleuze himself constructs in working out his philosophy, with the arts, political movements, even the neurosciences and artificial intelligence.</p></p><p>John Rajchman is Visiting Professor of Art History at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and at Columbia University.<p>Anyone who thinks Deleuze is difficult should read this extraordinary book. With language as clear as it is concise, Rajchman shows how Deleuze&#x2015;the self-styled most na�ve of philosophers&#x2015;has also been the most revolutionary in his reinvention of the twentieth century's image of thought with respect to logic, ethics, and art. For those new to Deleuze, this is the first book they should read. And for those who already follow the path of philosophy, Rajchman has shown us that it is not the past century that is Deleuzian, but the one we are beginning.</p>&#x2015;<b>D. N.

For the second edition Professor Kenyon has entirely rewritten his commentary to take account of the latest research in this field; he has thoroughly revised the structure of the book, and he has also strengthened the documentation in several important areas, notably the Interregnum, 1649-1660. The book is divided into four parts, the first three of which are devoted to the periods 1603-1640, 1640-1660 and 1660-1688 respectively. The fourth part deals with some of the general issues of government, at both central and local level, throughout the seventeenth century. One hundred and forty-six documents are included in all, and to aid the student reader speling and punctuation have been modernised. This volume forms a companion to the second edition of Professor Elton&#39;s The Tudor Constitution, and is likewise available in both hard and paper covers.</p><p>Originally published in 1966, this text established itself as the standard work in 17th century English history in the course of time.

The commentaries are important and helpful. They provide both interpretation and narrative with the emphasis changing according to the varying needs of the topics. The interpretation is vigorous and is not tightly confined by the documents ... Some may disagree with Professor Kenyon&#39;s selection or with his judgements, but all will be grateful. Deservedly this book will be much read and often consulted.

This elegant and streamlined textbook (of under 400 pages) aims to instill a deep understanding of physical chemistry by focusing exclusively on those ideas that are deemed to be either too important or too interesting to exclude. These core ideas are demystified by explaining where they come from, why they make sense, and how they may be applied to understanding topics ranging from molecular spectroscopy and chemical reactivity to biological self-assembly and liquid computer simulation strategies. Another unique feature of this groundbreaking textbook is the insight it provides into the scientific discovery process by highlighting the personal perspectives and conceptual struggles of people such as Gibbs, Einstein, and Schr�dinger, who pioneered this interesting and practically important field.</p></p><p></p><h2>Baroque Flute Pieces (Bk. 2)</h2><p>Baroque Flute Pieces Book 2, This five-volume graded anthology for playersof the modern flute, acts as an introduction to the flute music of the early and mid-eighteenth century.

Beginning with the classical sociology of Marx, Durkheim, Weber and Simmel, it goes on to examine the modern paradigms of functionalism, interactionism, structuralism and critical Marxism, and ends by discussing salient contemporary sociological theory, including the theories of Foucault, Baudrillard, Giddens, Habermas and others.

Its length and difficulty mean that readers often turn to critical studies to help them in getting the most out of it. But the vast quantity of secondary literature on the book poses problems for readers, who often don't know where to begin. This casebook includes some of the most influential critics to have written on Joyce, such as Hugh Kenner and Fritz Senn, as well as newer voices who have made a considerable impact in recent years. A wide range of critical schools is represented, from textual analysis to historical and psychoanalytic approaches, from feminism to post-colonialism. One essay considers the relation between art and life, nature and culture, in <em>Ulysses</em>, while another explores the implications of the impassioned debates about the proper editing of Joyce's great work. In an iconoclastic discussion of the book, Leo Bersani finds reasons for giving up reading Joyce. All the contributions are characterized by scrupulous attention to Joyce's words and a sense of the powerful challenge his work offers to our ways of thinking about ourselves, our world, and our language. Also included are records of some of the conversations Joyce had with his friend Frank Budgen during the composition of <em>Ulysses</em> in Zurich, and in an appendix readers will find a version of the schema which Joyce drew up as a guide to his book. Derek Attridge provides an introduction that offers advice on reading <em>Ulysses</em> for the first time, an account of the remarkable story of its composition, and an outline of the history of the critical reception that has played such an important part in our understanding and enjoyment of this extraordinary work.<br></p><p><br><strong>Derek Attridge</strong> is Professor of English at the University of York and Distinguished Visiting Professor at Rutgers University.<br><br>"Especially for students and scholars new to <em>Ulysses</em>, this casebook serves as a strong introduction to the critical conversation."--<em>English Literature in Transition 1880-1920</em><p></p><br></p><h2>Natural Pet Cures: Dog &amp; Cat Care the Natural Way</h2><p>Presents specialized information on easy-to-prepare homeopathic treatments for dogs and cats using herbs and other natural ingredients</p><p>Dr. John Heinerman is an internationally renowned medical anthropologist and expert on the healing properties of plans all over the world.

E. Allen&#x2019;s highly regarded translations of the dialogues of Plato have been praised for their faithfulness and readability. Many years in the making, his translation of <i>The Republic</i> has been eagerly awaited. It comes now to crown a distinguished classicist&#x2019;s efforts to make Plato&#x2019;s works available in readable and accurate translations. This new, lucid translation of Plato&#x2019;s greatest dialogue is the first major translation in English since the publication of F. M. Cornford&#x2019;s and G. M. A. Grube&#x2019;s renditions more than a generation ago. It is likely to be the standard translation for years to come.<br><br> This edition,&nbsp;intended for the student and general reader, is accompanied by Allen&#x2019;s notes and introduction. <i>The Republic</i> is, of course, many things: metaphysics and epistemology, moral psychology and ethics, educational theory and aesthetics, and poetry and eschatology. In his introduction, Allen takes up its threshold question&#x2014;the political&#x2014;and argues that its particular formulation by Plato had a direct and profound influence on the Founding Fathers and the development of American constitutional law.</p><p>In this influential two-volume edition, first published in 1902, the Scottish classicist James Adam examines the text of Plato&#39;s monumental political and philosophical dialogue. Volume 2 focuses on Books 6-10, which discuss the place of the philosopher and questions of governance.<p>This celebrated philosophical work of the fourth century B.C. contemplates the elements of an ideal state, serving as the forerunner for such other classics of political thought as Cicero's <i>De Republica</i>, St. Augustine's <i>City of God</i>, and Thomas More's <i>Utopia</i>.<br>Written in the form of a dialog in which Socrates questions his students and fellow citizens, <i>The Republic</i> concerns itself chiefly with the question, "What is justice?" as well as Plato's theory of ideas and his conception of the philosopher's role in society. To explore the latter, he invents the allegory of the cave to illustrate his notion that ordinary men are like prisoners in a cave, observing only the shadows of things, while philosophers are those who venture outside the cave and see things as they really are, and whose task it is to return to the cave and tell the truth about what they have seen. This dynamic metaphor expresses at once the eternal conflict between the world of the senses (the cave) and the world of ideas (the world outside the cave), and the philosopher's role as mediator between the two.</p><p></p></p><h2>Disciplinary Core Ideas: Reshaping Teaching and Learning</h2><p>Like all enthusiastic teachers, you want your students to see the connections between important science concepts so they can grasp how the world works now and maybe even make it work better in the future. But how exactly do you help them learn and apply these core ideas? Just as its subtitle says, this important book aims to reshape your approach to teaching and your students way of learning. Building on the foundation provided by A Framework for K 12 Science Education, which informed the development of the Next Generation Science Standards, the book s four sections cover these broad areas: 1. Physical science core ideas explain phenomena as diverse as why water freezes and how information can be sent around the world wirelessly. 2. Life science core ideas explore phenomena such as why children look similar but not identical to their parents and how human behavior affects global ecosystems. 3. Earth and space sciences core ideas focus on complex interactions in the Earth system and examine phenomena as varied as the big bang and global climate change. 4. Engineering, technology, and applications of science core ideas highlight engineering design and how it can contribute innovative solutions to society s problems. Disciplinary Core Ideas can make your science lessons more coherent and memorable, regardless of what subject matter you cover and what grade you teach. Think of it as a conceptual tool kit you can use to help your students learn important and useful science now and continue learning throughout their lives.</p><p></p><h2>Cambridge Academic English B2 Upper Intermediate Student&#39;s Book: An Integrated Skills Course for EAP (Cambridge Academic English Course)</h2><p>A three-level (B1+ to C1) integrated skills course for higher education students at university or on foundation courses.

The sentimental drama is associated with a philosophical one in allegorical form: how does a man live his life ... with intensity but in an existence of short duration, or without desires in a long life? The drama is expressed through the talisman, a wild ass&#39;s skin, given to the hero by an old antique dealer. The skin has magical powers: it enables the owner to satisfy any desire, but it shrinks each time it is used. The owner&#39;s life is mirrored by the shrinking skin.

The major additions are the chapters on majority-logic codes, synchronization, and convolutional codes. Much new material has also been added to the chapters on important linear block codes and cyclic codes. The authors cite some highly regarded books on recent work done in Eastern Europe and an extensive bibliography on coding theory in the Soviet Union [sic].

Looking closely at thirty telling cases from the pages of American legal history, Kerber's analysis reaches from the Revolution, when married women did not have the same obligation as their husbands to be "patriots," up to the present, when men and women, regardless of their marital status, still have different obligations to serve in the Armed Forces. </p><p>An original and compelling consideration of American law and culture, <i>No Constitutional Right to Be Ladies</i> emphasizes the dangers of excluding women from other civic responsibilities as well, such as loyalty oaths and jury duty. Exploring the lives of the plaintiffs, the strategies of the lawyers, and the decisions of the courts, Kerber offers readers a convincing argument for equal treatment under the law.</p></p><p>In the second half of the 20th century, "rights talk," characteristic of political and legal discourse in the United States, has been forcefully invoked by minorities and women in their respective quests for equal treatment under the law. In <i>No Constitutional Right to Be Ladies</i>, University of Iowa history professor Linda K. Kerber looks at the other side of the rights equation: the issue of obligations. Kerber argues that while men's rights have been bought by their obligations to public service, for women the obligations were to family. Absolution from public service--the constitutional right to be "ladies"--has clear roots in the principle of coverture, by which a woman's legal identity is absorbed by a man's, be it her father, husband, or other protector. This, Kerber writes, is not a boon for women. Women have always had obligations, she notes, it is merely "the forms and objects of demand" that have differed, and disparities between the obligations of men and women have affected women's qualitative ability to exercise rights, such as trial by a jury of one's peers. Kerber presents a series of narratives focusing on particular women whose situations became catalysts for political and legal change and the women, like Ruth Bader Ginsburg, who helped effect those transformations. <i>No Constitutional Right to Be Ladies</i> is engrossing reading for layperson and scholar alike. <i>--Julia Riches</i><p><b>Linda K.

The doctor refused. Why bother? The boy&#x2019;s life was effectively over. Campbell refused to accept this verdict. He demanded treatment and threatened legal action. The doctor finally relented. With treatment, Christopher&#x2019;s temperature subsided almost immediately. Soon afterwards he regained consciousness and today he is learning to walk again. This story is one of many Wesley J. Smith recounts in his groundbreaking new book, Culture of Death. Smith believes that American medicine ?is changing from a system based on the sanctity of human life into a starkly utilitarian model in which the medically defenseless are seen as having not just a ?right&#x2019; but a ?duty&#x2019; to die.&#x201d; Going behind the current scenes of our health care system, he shows how doctors withdraw desired care based on Futile Care Theory rather than providing it as required by the Hippocratic Oath. And how ?bioethicists&#x201d; influence policy by considering questions such as whether organs may be harvested from the terminally ill and disabled. This is a passionate, yet coolly reasoned book about the current crisis in medical ethics by an author who has made ?the new thanatology&#x201d; his consuming interest.</p><p>&#34;In Culture of Death,&#34; Wesley Smith, who has done vast research on assisted suicide and euthanasia, describes how many of us have gotten to the point of believing that some lives are not worth living.&#34; -Nat Hentoff &#34;Culture of Death promises to be a very major contribution to the discussion.&#34; -C.

Starr &amp; Co., which he joined as vice president in 1960, becoming a director in 1965 and Chairman and CEO in 1968.&nbsp; From 1967 until 2005, he was CEO of American International Group, which grew during that period from a scattered collection of insurance businesses worth about $300 million to the largest insurance company in world history, worth more than $180 billion.&nbsp; After he left AIG, the company's new leadership embarked on a radical transformation that put the company at the heart of the 2008 financial crisis and nearly destroyed it.&nbsp; He has been among the most active&nbsp;and influential international business executives in history.<br><br><b>Lawrence Cunningham:</b>&nbsp;the Henry St. George Tucker III Research Professor at George Washington University Law School and Director of GW's Center for Law, Economics and Finance (C-LEAF) in New York.&nbsp; He is the author of numerous books, including <i>The Essays of Warren Buffett: Lessons for Corporate America</i>, and articles, some of which are drawn on in <i>The AIG Story</i> on topics such as corporate governance and the financial crisis of 2008. &nbsp; On Amazon, Cunningham has been ranked one of the top 100 authors in the category of business and investing.In this gripping read, AIG's legendary CEO of forty years, Hank Greenberg, and corporate governance expert, Lawrence Cunningham, relate the complete, inside story of the rise and near-destruction of AIG. And it is a story extremely well told. Readers are regaled with tales from Maurice R. "Hank" Greenberg's firsthand experience at AIG, combined with Cunningham's additional research and interviews.<br><br>Not another self-serving business biography or dry corporate history, <i>The AIG Story</i> is a business <i>adventure</i>. In a well-crafted narrative, it tells the story of Greenberg, the free market visionary who, through his legendary genius for risk management, unsurpassed organizational skill and sheer tenacity, transformed a scattered collection of insurance businesses into American International Group, a global financial colossus with nearly $1 trillion in assets on its balance sheets--and how, in the process, he revolutionized the insurance industry.<br><br>At the same time, <i>The AIG Story</i> is a fascinating account of the world's rough ride toward globalization and the triumph of free and open markets over communism, nationalism, protectionism, and isolationism, and the significant role Greenberg and AIG played in that victory.<br><br>Integral to the story is the authors' well-informed take on the 2008 global financial crisis and AIG's part in it. Greenberg and Cunningham explain how, in 2005, beset by an army of overzealous lawyers and ambitious politicians--foremost among them, then New York Attorney General Eliot Spitzer--AIG was seriously wounded. And Greenberg and Cunningham describe how, three years later, in 2008, in an effort to save Wall Street from its own vices, the U.S. Government seized AIG, using it to funnel staggering amounts of bailout money to Goldman Sachs and other "too-big-to-fail" banks. Through Greenberg's direct involvement and Cunningham's craftsmanship, <i>The AIG Story</i> reveals much about those events which, until now, has been kept hidden from the public.<br><br>The only firsthand account of American International Group's rise and near-destruction, <i>The AIG Story</i> is both the compelling chronicle of one of the great business success stories of the twentieth century and a captivating history of the evolution of global capitalism over the past six decades.</p><h2>Drugs And Society, 11th Edition</h2><p>Thoroughly revised and updated, Drugs and Society, Eleventh Edition, contains the most current information available concerning drug use and abuse.

The moment I started using these techniques, I realized that by adapting them, my work knew no bounds. Every project that I start leads me to the type of process that I feel is a perfect way to display my vision. </p> <p> No matter your style of photography &#x2014; whether you are interested in landscapes, portraits, flowers, architecture, or something else entirely &#x2014; these processes are useful in continuing to interpret your image after the camera capture. Digital or film, it makes no difference. The process you choose is driven by the image, which leaves you open to ideas and discovery. </p> <p> A darkroom is helpful, but not necessary, for most of the processes discussed in my book, <i>Jill Enfield's Guide to Photographic Alternative Processes: Popular Historical and Contemporary Techniques</i>. You will learn about the materials needed to set up a workspace, which chemicals to use and how to mix them properly and safely, and where to get all of the above, no matter where you live. The tactile process of using hand-applied emulsions and then watching the image appear is always a magical experience! My hope is that this book brings the magic to others. </p> <p> Need inspiration? The work of 106 artists from all over the world is beautifully reproduced in the book. This is more than a mere how-to book; it is also a showcase of some of the best artists in the historical techniques genre. </p> <p> I hope that you enjoy <i>Jill Enfield's Guide to Photographic Alternative Processes</i> as much as I have had enjoyed creating it. </p> <p> Best wishes in creating your own magic, </p> <p> Jill Enfield </p><p>Jill Enfield, one of the most experienced and respected hand-coloring artists in the United States, is a fine art, editorial, and commercial photographer.

Contrary to popular understanding, the term does not mean "holy war." Nor does it simply refer to the inner spiritual struggle. This book, judiciously balanced, accessibly written, and highly relevant to today's events, unravels the tangled historical, intellectual, and political meanings of <i>jihad. </i>Looking closely at a range of sources from sacred Islamic texts to modern interpretations, <i>Understanding Jihad </i>opens a critically important perspective on the role of Islam in the contemporary world.<br><br>As David Cook traces the practical and theoretical meanings of <i>jihad, </i>he cites from scriptural, legal, and newly translated texts to give readers a taste of the often ambiguous information that is used to construct Islamic doctrine. He looks closely at the life and teaching of the Prophet Muhammad and at the ramifications of the great Islamic conquests in 634 to 732 A.D. He sheds light on legal developments relevant to fighting and warfare, and places the internal, spiritual jihad within the larger context of Islamic religion. He describes some of the conflicts that occur in radical groups and shows how the more mainstream supporters of these groups have come to understand and justify violence. He has also included a special appendix of relevant documents including materials related to the September 11 attacks and published manifestoes issued by Osama bin Laden and Palestinian suicide-martyrs.</p><p>"<i>Understanding Jihad</i> is one of the most helpful of the spate of new books to appear since the tragic events of September 11, 2001 on the debate about jihad in Islam. Cook's approach is based on historical and textual analyses, and is enhanced by valuable theoretical discussion. This book will help readers find their way through the vast literature by Muslims and non-Muslim scholars on what we can't seem to get away from calling 'holy war'."&#x2014;Richard C. Martin, Professor of Islamic Studies, Emory University<br><br>"This book is important to current political and religious discourse on the role of Islam in today's world, and increases our understanding of the seemingly odd behaviors we observe through the media.

After 1600, self-appointed investigators used the model of the land and cartographic surveys of the newly unified state to observe and order subjects such as agronomy, medicine, gastronomy, commerce, travel, and entertainment. They subsequently circulated their findings through a variety of commercially printed texts: maps, gazetteers, family encyclopedias, urban directories, travel guides, official personnel rosters, and instruction manuals for everything from farming to lovemaking. In this original and gracefully written book, Mary Elizabeth Berry considers the social processes that drove the information explosion of the 1600s. Inviting readers to examine the contours and meanings of this transformation, Berry provides a fascinating account of the conversion of the public from an object of state surveillance into a subject of self-knowledge.<br><br><i>Japan in Print </i>shows how, as investigators collected and disseminated richly diverse data, they came to presume in their audience a standard of cultural literacy that changed anonymous consumers into an &#x201c;us&#x201d; bound by common frames of reference. This shared space of knowledge made society visible to itself and in the process subverted notions of status hierarchy. Berry demonstrates that the new public texts projected a national collectivity characterized by universal access to markets, mobility, sociability, and self-fashioning.</p><p>&#x201c;Anyone interested in the history of media and communications should read Beth Berry's extraordinary book. Learned, lucid, and lively, it has much to teach students of premodern societies in Europe and elsewhere.&#x201d;&#x2015;Anthony Grafton, Henry Putnam University Professor of History, Princeton University<br><br>&#x201c;In <i>Japan in Print</i>, Mary Elizabeth Berry crisply condenses a remarkable amount of primary research on difficult and little-known materials, and it interprets those materials in a highly original framework. The scholarship is superb, and the writing is as masterful as the research. Anyone interested in East Asian cultural production will find this compelling reading.&#x201d;&#x2015;K�ren E. Wigen, author of <i>The Making of a Japanese Periphery, 1750-1920</i><br><br>&#x201c;This is a very important book, not only for its insights into a vast body of previously overlooked texts, but also for its methodology. While historians have known that early modern Japan produced maps, for example, no one has heretofore compared them to their medieval predecessors or examined them for what they say about an emerging Japanese cartographic imagination. This is a highly original work, and it will change the field.&#x201d;&#x2015;Anne Walthall, author of <i>The Weak Body of a Useless Woman: Matsuo Taseko and the Meiji Restoration</i><b>Mary Elizabeth Berry</b> is Professor of History at the University of California, Berkeley.

Of the fourteen essays, written from the late 1970's to the present, three have never before been published; the essays' appearance in a single volume makes available for the first time the full scope of Berger's unique approach to ethical discourses in Shakespeare's plays. The sequence of essays displays both the continuity and the revisionary development that mark his critical practice since the early work on <i>The Tempest</i>, <i>Troilus and Cressida</i>, and the Elizabethan theater.<br>When one compares Berger's earlier work from the 1960's with the writing from the 1980's and 1990's in the present collection, one sees that the difference stems primarily from the impact on the later work of his encounters with the whole range of structuralist and poststructuralist theory. Much of the excitement and vitality of Berger's current work comes from his efforts to incorporate new methodological influences into his previous system. Because he comes to poststructuralism as a mature critic whose larger interpretive framework is already in place, his response is not simply to immerse himself in the new theoretical modes and adopt them wholesale, but rather to make them his own.<br>Among the plays discussed are <i>The Merchant of Venice</i>, <i>Much Ado About Nothing</i>, <i>King Lear</i>, <i>Macbeth</i>, <i>2 Henry IV</i>, <i>Richard II</i>&#x2015;and, in two of the new essays, <i>1 Henry IV</i> and <i>Measure for Measure</i>. Also new is Berger's retrospective account of his critical development in the extensive opening "Acknowledgments."</p><p>&#x201c;This collection represents a decade of writing by a uniquely brilliant critic who combines intense sensitivity to textual nuance with extraordinary theoretical agility. Complex and sophisticated, these essays brim with thrills, gags, twists, and flashes. And Shakespeare's texts never quite read the same again.&#x201d;&#x2014;Margreta de Grazia, University of Pennsylvania.Harry Berger, Jr., is Professor Emeritus of Literature and Art History at the University of California, Santa Cruz.</p><h2>The Practice Revolution: Getting great results from the six days between lessons</h2><p>Inside the Practice Room: What works, what doesn't, what really happens, and how to fix it.

Its alphabetical arrangement makes most problems easy to locate. However, some sections in this book could have benefited from a less conservative approach. In the section on preventing accidents, for instance, it is advised that you should "never try to grab or touch a snake, even if you know it's not poisonous." This advice seems unnecessarily rigid. More effective (and less restrictive to a child's natural curiosity) is to teach children how to identify snakes (always ask first) and how to handle nonpoisonous ones safely (it's easy!). Sleep issues are handled with only a brief reference to unconventional options, which can be found in William Sears's Nighttime Parenting (La Leche League, 1985). Books covering much the same ground as The Doctors Book , although not as succinctly or simply, include Robert Pantell and others' Taking Care of Your Child (Addison-Wesley, 1990. 3d ed.) and George Wootan and Sarah Verney's Taking Charge of Your Child's Health ( LJ 8/92). For a more nonconformist approach , try Robert Mendelsohn's How To Raise a Healthy Child in Spite of Your Doctor ( LJ 5/15/84). Recommended for consumer health collections .

To combat sibling rivalry, for instance, "Don't ask who started it," the Rodale team instructs; instead of assigning blame, acknowledge anger, and try to work from and with it. About splinters: "Ignore the tiny tough ones," too difficult to remove, and apt to inch out on their own. And in the event of video game "addiction," parents are urged to "set limits" on the playing hours permitted, but also to play along, avoiding alienation of the generations. As is typical of Rodale titles, this one is well organized for browsing, as well as for more formal reference: big subheads and eye-catching sidebars direct the glance.

They provide readers with a comprehensive look at the challenging roles of police supervisors and managers; exciting and up-to-date coverage of issues, trends, and tactics; and focus on timely topics such as terrorism and policing in the community policing era. <b> </b> A four-part presentation contains expanded discussions of relevant and timely topics&#x2014;e.g., community policing and problem solving, ethics, patrol, critical incidents and disasters, organizational behavior, and administrative theory. <b> </b> For individuals working in the police field, use in law enforcement agencies, training academies, and in preparing for promotional examinations. </p></p><p><p> The authors bring more than 100 years of practical (including administrative, managerial, and supervisory) and academic police experience to this textbook; therefore, the chapters contain a "real world" flavor. A uniquely comprehensive view is provided of police supervision and management, and chapters also discuss such topics as critical incidents, tactical operations, patrol problems, officers' rights and discipline, community policing and problem solving, ethical issues and liability, and training and. evaluation. From beginning to end, the book provides an inside view of what are certainly difficult and challenging roles. </p><p> A comparatively large number of textbooks on police management and administration have been written over the past several decades, addressing the roles and responsibilities of chiefs of police or sheriffs. This text, however, focuses on first-line supervisors and middle managers and is grounded on the assumption that the reader is an undergraduate, possibly even a graduate, student or a neophyte practitioner, possessing but a fundamental knowledge of police organizations and operations. It is intended to help those persons learn more about the field of policing, as well as help those practitioners who are preparing for promotion, and new and experienced supervisors who are seeking to improve their skills. It will help to lay the foundation for the reader's future study and experience. </p> <p> This text also assumes that a <i>practical</i> police supervision perspective is often lost in many administrative texts; therefore, while necessarily delving into some theory, this text is intended to focus on the practical aspects of a supervisor's or manager's job. </p> <p> Those of us who have held a job or position, unless self-employed, have had a supervisor to whom we reported. That individual probably had a hand in showing us how to do our work and certainly was responsible for making sure that we did it properly. Even persons who have not yet entered the working world have experienced supervision in school, in sports, in the Boy Scouts or Girl Scouts, or in other nonwork settings. Supervision is a crucial element of any organized activity and is present in all organizations. </p> <p> Our supervisors often reported to <i>their</i> supervisors, or managers. The managers coordinated and supervised the efforts of the lower-level supervisors as well as ensuring that the unit functioned as higher-level administrators envisioned. Supervisors and managers are the keys to quality work in any organization. </p> <p> This book specifically concerns <i>police</i> supervision and management. In order to address these topics thoroughly and to provide as much useful information as possible, we must maintain a dual approach by looking at supervision and management broadly, while also focusing narrowly on these areas in police organizations. All supervisors and managers, whether in police departments, construction, or business firms, share similar concerns and duties. They manage people and activities. </p> <p> It is also true that each and every organization is unique. Police departments in particular are different from most other organizations, for the simple reason that police work is different from most other vocations and occupations. Police officers have the unique authority to arrest people and investigate their activities. Also, police departments are not all made from the same mold. The New York City Police Department and the Chicago Police Department, the two largest departments in the United States, are different from the Las Vegas Police Department or the Nashville Police Department. Although all of these departments have the same or similar responsibilities, substantial variation within the police profession itself makes the job of police supervisors or managers unique and challenging. In addition, the police supervisors' and managers' jobs have recently been made even more specialized as a result of the implementation of community policing. Community policing has placed many new responsibilities on the police sergeant and manager. </p> <p> During the course of a workday, police supervisors and managers directly oversee several employees in the performance of their activities and may even supervise a life-threatening situation or a critical incident or disaster. While a supervisor may not have ultimate command and control over critical incidents or disasters, he or she is often the first responder at the scene; his or her actions and directions to subordinates will be vital in determining the eventual success of the police in dealing with the problem. Managers are called to the scenes of major critical incidents to supervise groups of officers and to coordinate actions with other police units or agencies, such as the fire department or emergency medical services. Supervisors and managers essentially ensure that police operations unfold as planned. </p> <p><b>KEY TERMS</b></p> <p> Although the terms <i>administration, management,</i> and <i>supervision</i> are often used synonymously, it should be noted that each is a unique concept that occasionally overlaps with the others. <b>Administration</b> encompasses both management and supervision. Administration is a process whereby a group of people are organized and directed toward achievement of the group's objective. The exact nature of the organization will vary among the different types and sizes of agencies, but the general principles used and the form of administration are often similar. Administration focuses on the overall organization and its mission and its relationship with other organizations and groups external to it. Administrators are often concerned with the department's direction and its policies and with ensuring that the department has the resources to fulfill its community's expectations. Police administrators generally include the chief, assistant chiefs, and high-ranking staff who support the chief in administering the department. </p> <p> <b>Management,</b> which is also a part of administration, is most closely associated with the day-to-day operations of the various elements within the organization. For example, most police departments have a variety of operational units such as patrol, criminal investigation, traffic, gang enforcement, domestic violence, or community relations. The Los Angeles Police Department, the third largest police department in the country, has more than 200 specialized units. Each of these units is run by someone who is most aptly described as a manager. In most cases, these managers are captains or lieutenants. These managers ensure that their units fulfill their departmental mission and work closely with other units to ensure that conflict or problems do not develop. They also attend to planning, budgeting, and human resource or personnel needs to ensure that the unit is adequately prepared to carry out its responsibilities. </p> <p> <b>Supervision</b> involves the direction of officers and civilians in their day-today activities, often on a one-to-one basis. Supervisors ensure that subordinate officers adhere to departmental policies, complete tasks correctly and on a timely basis, and interact with the public in a professional manner. Supervisors often observe their subordinates completing assignments and sometimes take charge of situations, especially when a deployment of a large number of officers is needed. They also work closely with managers to ensure that officers' activities are consistent with the unit's mission and objectives. </p> <p> In the police organization, the first-line supervisor is usually a sergeant. We say <i>first-line</i> because sergeants are responsible for supervising those officers who are engaged in providing basic police services. Captains and lieutenants (called middle managers) also supervise, but they supervise persons who are also supervisors, and are more concerned with a unit's activities rather than with an individual officer's activities. In actuality, all ranking personnel from the chief to the sergeant supervise, but this text is concerned with supervision by sergeants and mid-level managers. </p> <p> Finally, the terms <i>police officer, law enforcement officer,</i> and <i>peace officer</i> are also generally interchangeable. The primary difference is that peace officer refers to anyone who has arrest authority and usually includes correctional officers, probation officers, parole officers, and persons with special police powers. Correctional officers have specific police powers in their correctional facility workplace, and investigators of welfare or Medicaid fraud have limited peace officer powers. In this text, we are primarily concerned with police officers, who include municipal or rural officers; deputy sheriffs; highway patrol; troopers; state police; and others holding local, state, or federal law enforcement officer status. For the purpose of this text, the term <i>police officer</i> will generally be used to refer to all the positions noted. </p> <p><b>ORGANIZATION OF THE BOOK</b></p> <p> The 14 chapters of this book are organized to provide the reader with an understanding of the key elements of police supervision and management from both the theoretical and applied perspectives. To understand the challenges of police supervision and management, we must first place it within the "big picture" of a police organization. Thus, Part One, "The Supervisor in a Police Organization," introduces the concepts of supervision and management, the roles and responsibilities of supervisors and middle managers, leadership and motivation, and effective communication and negotiation in an organization. </p> <p> Part Two examines the supervision of human resources. This section addresses training, evaluation, stress and wellness, ethics and liability, and subordinates' rights and discipline. It essentially provides information on the "people" in the police organization. Somewhere between 75 and 90 percent of a police department's budget is for personnel. It is therefore important for the supervisor and manager to learn how to manage this important resource. These chapters elaborate how the police department via the supervisor and manager work with people, motivate them, and ensure that the department's mission is achieved. </p> <p> Part Three, "Supervising the Work of Police," contains information that is more applied in nature and reviews supervisors and managers at work, both on and off the street. It addresses what they need to know concerning officer deployment and scheduling, patrol and special operations, tactical operations and critical incidents, and community oriented policing and problem solving (COPPS). COPPS is now policing's primary paradigm and, as seen in Chapter 13, has had a profound impact on h...</p></p><h2>The Desert War: The classic trilogy on the North African campaign 1940-1943</h2><p><p>Alan Moorehead was a peerless war correspondent who covered the entire war in North Africa from 1940-1943.

We can actually observe a person's brain registering a joke or experiencing a painful memory. Drawing on the latest imaging technology and the expertise of distinguished scientists, Rita Carter explores the geography of the human brain. Her writing is clear, accessible, witty, and the book's 150 illustrations&#x2014;most in color&#x2014;present an illustrated guide to that wondrous, coconut-sized, wrinkled gray mass we carry inside our heads.<br><br><i>Mapping the Mind</i> charts the way human behavior and culture have been molded by the landscape of the brain. Carter shows how our personalities reflect the biological mechanisms underlying thought and emotion and how behavioral eccentricities may be traced to abnormalities in an individual brain. Obsessions and compulsions seem to be caused by a stuck neural switch in a region that monitors the environment for danger. Addictions stem from dysfunction in the brain's reward system. Even the sense of religious experience has been linked to activity in a certain brain region. The differences between men and women's brains, the question of a "gay brain," and conditions such as dyslexia, autism, and mania are also explored.<br><br>Looking inside the brain, writes Carter, we see that actions follow from our perceptions, which are due to brain activity dictated by a neuronal structure formed from the interplay between our genes and the environment. Without sidestepping the question of free will, Carter suggests that future generations will use our increasing knowledge of the brain to "enhance those mental qualities that give sweetness and meaning to our lives, and to eradicate those that are destructive."</p><p>In the last decades of the 20th century, scientists have come to believe that the human brain is almost completely modular. Every bit of the brain does something in particular, and surprisingly specific abilities, memories, and responses are in localized areas. Journalist Rita Carter has drawn a map of what is known (and speculated) about the mind in a heavily illustrated field guide to the human brain.<p> Carter and her scientific editor, neuropsychologist Christopher Frith, cover the state of the mind in a reasonably accurate, accessible way. They emphasize topics that are likely to be of some practical interest--such as Alzheimer's or attention deficit disorder--but not so much as to give a distorted picture of the field.</p><p> Perhaps the most interesting parts of the book are the sidebars written by a variety of leading names in mind-brain science. Roger Penrose writes on computer minds, Francis Crick on consciousness, Steven Rose on memory, John Maynard Smith on social evolution, William Calvin on mosaic minds, Kay Redfield Jamison on creativity and bipolar disorders, and more.

Well known for his mathematical games column in <i>Scientific American</i> and his "Trick of the Month" in <i>Physics Teacher</i> magazine, Gardner attracted a loyal following with his intelligence, wit, and imagination. <p><b>Martin Gardner: A Remembrance <br></b>The worldwide mathematical community was saddened by the death of Martin Gardner on May 22, 2010. Martin was 95 years old when he died, and had written 70 or 80 books during his long lifetime as an author. Martin's first Dover books were published in 1956 and 1957: <i>Mathematics, Magic and Mystery,</i> one of the first popular books on the intellectual excitement of mathematics to reach a wide audience, and <i>Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science,</i> certainly one of the first popular books to cast a devastatingly skeptical eye on the claims of pseudoscience and the many guises in which the modern world has given rise to it. Both of these pioneering books are still in print with Dover today along with more than a dozen other titles of Martin's books. They run the gamut from his elementary <i>Codes, Ciphers and Secret Writing,</i> which has been enjoyed by generations of younger readers since the 1980s, to the more demanding <i>The New Ambidextrous Universe: Symmetry and Asymmetry from Mirror Reflections to Superstrings,</i> which Dover published in its final revised form in 2005. </p><p> </p><p>To those of us who have been associated with Dover for a long time, however, Martin was more than an author, albeit a remarkably popular and successful one. As a member of the small group of long-time advisors and consultants, which included NYU's Morris Kline in mathematics, Harvard's I. Bernard Cohen in the history of science, and MIT's J. P. Den Hartog in engineering, Martin's advice and editorial suggestions in the formative 1950s helped to define the Dover publishing program and give it the point of view which &#x2014; despite many changes, new directions, and the consequences of evolution &#x2014; continues to be operative today. </p><p><b> </b></p><p><b>In the Author's Own Words:<br></b>"Politicians, real-estate agents, used-car salesmen, and advertising copy-writers are expected to stretch facts in self-serving directions, but scientists who falsify their results are regarded by their peers as committing an inexcusable crime.

It was a lacerating attack on integration, and set the agenda for black cultural, social, and political autonomy. A classic of African American social thought, the book and its author went on to influence generations of activists, artists, and scholars. Cruse's intelligence, independence, and breadth of vision virtually defined what it meant to be a black intellectual in modern America. In this first anthology of Cruse's writing, William Jelani Cobb provides a powerful introduction to Cruse's wide body of work, including published material such as excerpts from <i>Crisis</i>, as well as unpublished essays, speeches, and correspondence. <i>The Essential Harold Cruse</i> is certain to become standard reading for anyone interested in race in American society.</p></p><p><p><b>William Jelani Cobb</b>'s writings appear regularly in the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Washington City Paper</i>, and <i>Africana.com</i>. He received his Ph.D. in American History from Rutgers University. He lives in Brooklyn, NY.</p>Editor Cobb (visiting assistant professor, history, Spelman Coll.) here offers essential reading for anyone interested in black politics and culture. Cruse is known mostly for his classic text, The Crisis of the Negro Intellectual, and his anti-integrationist and black nationalist views. His writings are respectful of some of America's greatest thinkers and cultural workers, e.g., James Baldwin, Lorraine Hansberry, and W.E.B. DuBois, but he doesn't hold back when eloquently disputing their ideas and actions. Cruse brings his critical analysis to bear on issues like black leadership and aesthetics, the interrelationship of politics and culture, civil disobedience, capitalism, the establishment of a black independent political party, and the realities of American culture topics still worthy of debate today. The reader is arranged thematically and chronologically, from Cruse's years in the Communist Party and as a playwright in Greenwich Village (1951-63) to the publication of Plural but Equal. A 1997 interview with Cruse closes the collection. Cruse's legacy is awe-inspiring, and this new work is highly recommended for public and academic libraries.

This work, a chapter from Kierkegaard's first major volume, <i>Either/Or</i>, springs from his relationship with his fianc�e, Regine Olsen. Kierkegaard fell in love with the young woman, ten years his junior, proposed to her, but then broke off their engagement a year later. This event affected Kierkegaard profoundly. Olsen became a muse for him, and a flood of volumes resulted. His attempt to set right, in writing, what he feels was a mistake in his relationship with Olsen taught him the secret of "indirect communication." <i>The Seducer's Diary</i>, then, becomes Kierkegaard's attempt to portray himself as a scoundrel and thus make their break easier for her.</p><br><p> Matters of marriage, the ethical versus the aesthetic, dread, and, increasingly, the severities of Christianity are pondered by Kierkegaard in this intense work.</p></p><p>The text is from <b>Howard V.

By blending the distinct teachings of Deuteronomy and the Priestly literature, Dozeman provides a unique interpretation of holy war as a form of sacred genocide, arguing that, since peace in the promised land required the elimination of the populations of all existent royal cities, a general purging of the land accompanied the progress of the ark of the covenant. This essential work of religious scholarship demonstrates how the theme of total genocide is reinterpreted as partial conquest when redactors place Joshua, an independent book, between Deuteronomy and Judges. The author traces the evolution of this reinterpretation of the central themes of religious violence while providing a comparison of the two textual versions of Joshua and an insightful analysis of the book&#x2019;s reception history.</p><p><b>Thomas B.

In a single sentence, with its reference to the notorious plot of Agatha Christie's sixth novel, <i>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</i>, he struck deep at the collective spirit of a community of like-minded souls: the detective fiction readers of the world. Ever since 1926, when the novel in question was first published, helping to insure its author's reputation as the ruling queen of crafty crime, mystery fans have indeed cared. Passionately.<p> But until the arrival of this provocative rereading of the case, written by a psychoanalyst and translated from the French, it is likely that not one of them ever doubted the validity of the solution as worked out by the redoubtable Hercule Poirot. After all, if the author's own detective had incorrectly followed the clues laid down for him, what kind of unsteady ground was the reader left standing on?</p><p> Although Bayard makes it clear that those picking up his book don't necessarily have to return to the original text--he does give a very concise summary of the principal characters and actions of Christie's story--it is an exercise, really a pleasure, that I urge you toward. <i>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</i> is such a landmark of the genre that it is not just a bit of nostalgia, a form of genial time travel, but also a reminder of what the Golden Age of the mystery novel was all about: the matching of wits between writer and reader, with puzzles that truly puzzled and were made all the more satisfying by the operative credo of fair play.</p><p> To address the actual plot of <i>The Murder of Roger Ackroyd</i> is to risk spoiling the fun. Let's just say there is an English village, King's Abbott, in which a bluff country squire, the much-mentioned Ackroyd, resides until his untimely death, [stabbed] by an unknown assailant. Unfortunately for the murderer--or so one used to think, pre-Pierre Bayard--there is also in the village a retired Belgian police inspector, the unparalleled M. Hercule Poirot. Poirot's celebrated "little grey cells," those he uses to form his theories of a case, steadily power the investigation to its startling conclusion, one that has always been as magnificent for its shock value as for its apparently irrefutable logic. That Professor Bayard's delicate probing of the book's structure manages to turn it convincingly in a fresh direction, toward an actual murderer <i>never even suspected</i>, is a triumph of scholarship that is at once playful and serious.</p><p> How we approach classic texts should never be as static an experience as we generally allow it to be, a truth proved anew by <i>Who Killed Roger Ackroyd</i>? It now joins a list of other similarly clever literary treats, among which I include Rex Stout's "Watson Was a Woman" and Frederick Crews's <i>The Pooh Perplex</i>. <i>--Otto Penzler</i></p>Pierre Bayard is a psychoanalyst and Professor of French Literature in Paris.</p><h2>The Art of Literary Research</h2><p><p><strong>Since <em>The Art of Literary Research</em> was first published in 1963, it has been the established guide to the purposes, methods, and pleasures of research in English and American literature. It is the essential companion for courses in bibliography and research techniques and for programs in independent study, advanced composition, and undergraduate honors.</strong></p><p>For interested readers who have other vocational plans, its authors-experienced researchers themselves-provide an intimate view of the way professional scholars go about their specialized and challenging tasks.</p><p>This extensively revised Fourth Edition takes full account of recent developments that have virtually revolutionized certain important areas of the discipline. The computer, as newly written pages demonstrate, not only has eliminated much of the drudgery formerly associated with the gathering, storage, and retrieval of raw data but has made possible many analytical and lexical operations that had been beyond human capacity, yet without diminishing the amount of sheer brain work still required to produce a genuine contribution to knowledge. The book also suggests that "traditional" literary studies, freshly evaluated, are compatible with the current emphasis on critical theory, not inimical to it.</p><p>The ongoing revision of the literary canon under the impact of women's studies, African-American studies, and other movements, as well as the intensified scholarly and critical interest in present-day writers, is reflected in the book's hundreds of illustrative examples, extensive lists of several related books and articles, and hands-on exercises. The exercises range from the simple, short answer type that offer practice in the use of secondary materials such as can be found in any college library, to projects that may occupy a number of weeks of research in primary sources and are geared to the extensive holdings of large university libraries.</p><p>The basic rationale and structure of the book, having proved themselves in previous editions, remain unchanged. The first half outlines the principles underlying the critical examination of evidence and describes in detail the chief branches of literary inquiry. Further chapters offer practical advice on bibliographical procedure and note-taking, particularly as these are made more efficient by electronic aids, and on the writing of scholarly papers (in one of the best discussions of the craft of expository prose t be found in any textbook); guide the student through the great American and British libraries whose stocks of books and manuscripts are indispensable to original literary research; and reviews the rewards, obligations, and ethics of the profession.</p></p><p></p><h2>Hard Times</h2><p>This edition of &#34;Hard Times&#34; includes an introduction by Philip Collins.

Brown&#x2019;s magisterial three-volume commentary on the Gospel According to John, all of the major Johannine questions&#x2015;of authorship, composition, dating, the relationship of John to the Synoptics (Mark, Matthew, and Luke)&#x2015;are discussed. The important theories of modern biblical scholarship concerning John are weighed against the evidence given in the text and against prevailing biblical research. In sum, what is attempted is a synthesis of the major scholarly insights that bear on the Fourth Gospel. <br><br>The translation&#x2015;as Father Brown states at the outset&#x2015;strives not for any formal beauty but rather for an accurate and contemporary version: &#x201c;the simple, everyday Greek of the Gospel has been rendered into the ordinary American English of today.&#x201d; The result is a translation that will strike the reader with uncommon immediacy.<br><br>Father Brown also analyzes, in the appendixes, the meaning, use, and frequency of certain key words and phrases that occur in John, and examines the differences between the Johannine and Synoptic treatments of the miracle stories.<br>The chapters of the Gospel translated here in Volume 29 (1&#x2013;12) comprise the Prologue, which opens with the famous &#x201c;In the beginning was the Word,&#x201d; and the Book of Signs, an account of the miracles of Jesus and of his ministry.</p></p><p><p>Over his illustrious career, <b>Raymond E. Brown, S.S., Ph.D.</b>, was internationally regarded as a dean of New Testament scholars. He was Auburn Distinguished Professor Emeritus of Biblical Studies at Union Theological Seminary in New York City. Among his more than thirty-five books on the Bible are three volumes in the Anchor Bible series, as well as the Anchor Bible Reference Library volumes <i>The Birth of the Messiah</i>,<i> The Death of the Messiah</i>, and <i>An Introduction to the New Testament</i>, winner of the 1998 Catholic Press Association Award for Biblical Studies.</p></p><h2>The Scarlet Letter: Easy Read Edition: Everything You Need in Half the Time</h2><p><b>Easy Read Edition: Everything You Need in Half the Time</b> <p> This edition of The Scarlet Letter is the Easy Read Edition.

Each chapter first describes key concepts and developments in the field (Ideas), then presents the main theoretical and analytical approaches (Arguments), and finally applies the main theories and approaches within the individual, state, and global contexts (Contexts and Applications). Historical information is woven throughout the text, and every chapter ends with an extended case study ("The Uses of History") that demonstrates how what we have learned from the past can influence our future actions. Three full chapters on key approaches--realism (chapter 2), liberalism (chapter 3), and constructivism and other alternative views (chapter 4)--introduce students to a broad spectrum of approaches, and each chapter integrates discussions of relevant theories and levels of analysis. Visual Reviews at the end of each chapter not only recap key points but include Critical Thinking questions that reflect the chapter learning objectives.</p><p><br><strong>Eric B.

It is also well organized and includes clear and concise learning objectives. The consistency of presentation/organization around theoretical paradigms and levels of analysis, in addition to the consistent inclusion of "learning goals," is the primary strength. Also important is the conversational tone and effort to develop introductory paragraphs that meet students where most of them are -- vaguely aware of the most popular, if not most important, cases." --Juliann Emmons Allison, <em>UC Riverside</em><p></p><br>"I believe Shiraev and Zubok, unlike the authors of most IR textbooks, made a wise decision to adopt a consistent chapter outline, which focuses on three basic and vitally important questions. This creative and unique approach helps to focus students' minds on the big picture, which is how to apply the different theoretical perspectives to reality. Shiraev and Zubok have done an exemplary job of applying IR theories to historical and contemporary reality, as well as applying IR theories in the individual, state, and global contexts." --Mir Zohair Husain, <em>University of South Alabama</em><p></p><br>The text differentiates itself from others with the chapter learning objectives, which serves as a guidepost for the various discussions and lessons packed into each chapter. -Richard Aidoo, Coastal Carolina University<p></p><br>What makes this book different is its shorter focus and to-the-point perspective. It does not spend a lot of pages on ancillary empirical questions. It gets to the heart of the theoretical issues and brings in enough empirics to make the points required, but no more. This is a good thing... Lots of empirical examples to help provide context as to what IR is and how it is studied is helpful...I thought it subtly introduced a lot of important theoretical ideas without being bogged down in theoretical language that may be difficult for students to understand. -Marcus Holmes, College of William &amp; Mary<p></p><br>Conceptually rich textbook with consistent structure bridging theory and empirical world. Not many textbooks have such consistent structure and rich conceptual content. -Mariam Dekanozishvili, Coastal Carolina University<p></p><br>"Shiraev and Zubok have produced a textbook that is rich with illustrations and case studies. It also does a commendable job of consistently addressing dominant concepts and theories in the academic literature (the three levels of analyses, the realist, liberalist, and constructivist views).

Heywood examines the different ways in which people have thought about childhood as a stage of life, the relationships of children with their families and peers, and the experiences of young people at work, in school and at the hands of various welfare institutions. The aim is to place the history of children and childhood firmly in its social and cultural context, without losing sight of the many individual experiences that have come down to us in diaries, autobiographies and oral testimonies.<br> Heywood argues that there is a cruel paradox at the heart of childhood in the past. On the one hand, material conditions for children have generally improved in the West, however belatedly and unevenly, and they are now more valued than in the past. On the other hand, the business of preparing for adulthood has become more complicated in urban and industrial societies, as the young face a bewildering array of choices and expectations.<br> A History of Childhood will be an essential introduction to the subject for students of history, the social sciences and cultural studies.</p><p><b>Colin Heywood</b> is Senior Lecturer in Economic and Social History, University of Nottingham.'...Colin Heywood's <i>A History of Childhood</i> is an interesting addition to the growing literature on children.' <b>Children's Geographies</b><br> <p>'...<i>A History of Childhood</i> represents a fine achievement and undoubtedly deserves a wide audience.

Dent, the Everyman Library has always tried to make the best books ever written available to the greatest number of people at the lowest possible price. Unique editorial features that help Everyman Paperback Classics stand out from the crowd include: a leading scholar or literary critic&#39;s introduction to the text, a biography of the author, a chronology of her or his life and times, a historical selection of criticism, and a concise plot summary. All books published since 1993 have also been completely restyled: all type has been reset, to offer a clarity and ease of reading unique among editions of the classics; a vibrant, full-color cover design now complements these great texts with beautiful contemporary works of art. But the best feature must be Everyman&#39;s uniquely low price. Each Everyman title offers these extensive materials at a price that competes with the most inexpensive editions on the market-but Everyman Paperbacks have durable binding, quality paper, and the highest editorial and scholarly standards.In 1845 Henry David Thoreau left his pencil-manufacturing business and began building a cabin on the shore of Walden Pond near Concord, Massachusetts. This lyrical yet practical-minded book is at once a record of the 26 months Thoreau spent in withdrawal from society -- an account of the daily minutiae of building, planting, hunting, cooking, and, always, observing nature -- and a declaration of independence from the oppressive mores of the world he left behind. Elegant, witty, and quietly searching, Walden remains the most persuasive American argument for simplicity of life clarity of conscience.<br><br>For the first time, the authoritative editions of works by major American novelists, poets, scholars, and essayists collected in the hardcover volumes of The Library of America are being published singly in a series of handsome paperback books. A distinguished writer has contributed an introduction for each volume, which also includes a chronology of the author's life and career, an essay on the text, and notes.<br><i>From the Trade Paperback edition.</i></p><h2>Fire In The Thatch A Devon Mystery</h2><p>The Second World War is drawing to a close. Nicholas Vaughan, released from the army after an accident, takes refuge in Devon - renting a thatched cottage in the beautiful countryside at Mallory Fitzjohn. Vaughan sets to work farming the land, rearing geese and renovating the cottage. Hard work and rural peace seem to make this a happy bachelor life. On a nearby farm lives the bored, flirtatious June St Cyres, an exile from London while her husband is a Japanese POW. June&#39;s presence attracts fashionable visitors of dubious character, and threatens to spoil Vaughan&#39;s Prized seclusion. When Little Thatch is destroyed in a blaze, all Vaughan&#39;s work goes up in smoke - and Inspector Macdonald is drafted in to uncover a motive for murder.</p><p>E. C. R.

In <i>Shoptalk</i>, Pulitzer Prize-winner Donald Murray has collected quotations from over 450 classic and contemporary writers that reveal the myriad stages writers pass through to completion of a work.

In 615 distinct propositions that deliberately echo the Commandments of Jewish Law, Kitaj here channels his ideas for a new Diasporist art in a daring stream of consciousness. Including 41 images of the artist&#39;s work chosen by him to accompany the text, this beautifully crafted volume is a unique and fascinating look into an artist&#39;s unusual life and work. From &#34;The Second Diasporist Manifesto&#34; is: &#39;But I swore to become myself - the new Jewish painter of a skeptical Diasporist art, born in Modernism, which cleaves to my own uncanny Jewish life of study, painting, unthinkable thoughts and near death...I admit that my Manifesto-poem is very personal, as a poem can be. But one would have to also unpack the cultural secrets of a book on Islamic Art, or Chinese or Egyptian or African Art. My Jewish Art lives a more Modernist Secret life. The Jewish Diaspora is not the only one. It&#39;s just mine.&#39;</p><p>R. B. Kitaj, described by John Russell as &#39;the most inventive of living representational painters&#39;, won the Grand Prize for Painting (Gold Lion) at the Venice Biennale in 1995. Kitaj is one of only a handful of American painters who has been given a retrospective at The Metropolitan Museum of Art during his own lifetime. His work is in museum collections worldwide."<i>The Second Diasporist Manifesto</i> comes straight out of the artist's workroom.&nbsp;It's a crucial document of our postmodern period, a book that reimagines modernism in a very personal way.&nbsp;Kitaj has written&nbsp; a searching artistic confession that's also a dazzling literary achievement."&#x2014;Jed Perl (Jed Perl)<br><br>"A quick read, but a must read. There is more raw energy, more ideas per page, more connections drawn between alternative worlds, more 'art,' and more God talk in this exploration of possibilities than one typically finds in more deliberative explorations of Jewish identity and thought."--Zachary Braiterman, <i>Religious Studies Review</i> (Zachary Braiterman <i>Religious Studies Review</i>)</p><h2>Sedimentary Environments: Processes, Facies and Stratigraphy</h2><p><i>Sedimentary Environments</i> is one of the most distinguished and influential textbooks in the earth sciences published in the last 20 years.

This distance begins to appear in Virgil and Ovid, but it becomes decisive in Dante and in his decision to write in the vernacular. His vernacular Italian reaches back through classical allusion to the Latin that was in his day the language of theology, but it does so with a difference. It is no accident that in the <i>Commedia</i> Virgil is Dante's guide.<br>The book opens with a discussion of just how Dante's poem is a "comedy," and it concludes with a discussion of the "ends of poetry" in a variety of senses: enjambment at the ends of lines, the concluding lines of poems, and the end of poetry as a mode of writing this sort of literature. Of course, to have poetry "end" does not mean that people stop writing it, but that literature passes into a period in which it is concerned with its own ending, with its own bounds and limits, historical and otherwise.<br>Though most of the essays make specific reference to various authors of the Italian literary tradition (including Dante, Polifilo, Pascoli, Delfini, and Caproni), they transcend the confines of Italian literature and engage several other literary and philosophical authors (Plato, Aristotle, the Stoics, Boethius, the Proven�al poets, Mallarm�, and H�lderlin, among others).</p><p>Giorgio Agamben teaches philosophy at the University of Verona.

In 1902, a sixteen-year-old Weston took up photography in Highland Park, Illinois, where he worked as an amateur for five years. In 1907, at the age of twenty-one, Weston moved to Tropico, California, now the city of Glendale in Los Angeles County, where he constructed his first studio and set about with great purpose to become a photographic artist. Examining Weston's earliest sharp- and soft-focus photographs reveals that the young artist had already formed a perfect sense of composition that was to be the hallmark of his later work.<br> <br>Presenting Weston's earliest work from a recently discovered family album, Edward Weston: Portrait of the Young Man as an Artist compares the artist's naive first artistic efforts with his latest masterworks to show the persistence and evolution of his singular vision to find essential form in the vernacular with an ever-increasing intensity.<br> <br>As a young man deeply intuitive and original in his creative expression, Edward Weston demonstrates that his teenage work, beginning with his amateur snapshots, embrace the same significant form as the later work for which he is now considered a master.<br></p><p>Graham Howe is the CEO of Pasadena based arts organization Curatorial Assistance, which he founded in 1988.

Based on thousands of pages of Bureau of Investigation reports, this historical detective saga traces the four-year hunt for the perpetrators, a worldwide effort that spread as far as Italy and the new Soviet nation. It also takes readers back into the decades-long but little-known history of homegrown terrorism that shaped American society a century ago. The book delves into the lives of victims, suspects, and investigators: world banking power J.P. Morgan, Jr.; labor radical "Big Bill" Haywood; anarchist firebrands Emma Goldman and Luigi Galleani; "America's Sherlock Holmes," William J. Burns; even a young J. Edgar Hoover. It grapples as well with some of the most controversial events of its day, including the rise of the Bureau of Investigation, the federal campaign against immigrant "terrorists," the grassroots effort to define and protect civil liberties, and the establishment of anti-communism as the sine qua non of American politics. Many Americans saw the destruction of the World Trade Center as the first major terrorist attack on American soil, an act of evil without precedent. The Day Wall Street Exploded reminds us that terror, too, has a history.<p></p></p><p>Just after noon on September 16, 1920, as hundreds of workers poured onto Wall Street for their lunchtime break, a horse-drawn cart packed with dynamite exploded in a spray of metal and fire, turning the busiest corner of the financial center into a war zone. Thirty-nine people died and hundreds more lay wounded, making the Wall Street explosion the worst terrorist attack to that point in U.S. history. In <em>The Day Wall Street Exploded</em>, Beverly Gage tells the story of that once infamous but now largely forgotten event. <br><br> <p><b>Take a Look at Wall Street Political Cartoons</b></p> Political cartoons in 1920 reflected public perceptions of the attack on Wall Street and its aftermath.

Numerous worked examples and exercises are included throughout to help assimilate concepts, consider implications of relations developed in the book, and apply concepts to local conditions. This book provides an introduction to hydrological science and its concepts including Climate, the Hydrologic Cycle, Soils and Vegetation, Precipitation, Snow and Snowmelt, Water in Soils: Infiltration and Redistribution, Evapotranspiration, Ground Water in the Hydrological Cycle, Stream Response to Water-Input Events, Hydrology and Water-Resource Management. Suitable as a reference work for professionals already working in the field. It can also serve as a comprehensive, readily understood introduction to hydrology for professionals in related fields.</p><p>Titles of related interest also from Waveland Press: Chapra, Surface Water-Quality Modeling (ISBN 9781577666059); Fetter, Contaminant Hydrogeology, Second Edition (ISBN 9781577665830) and Gupta, Hydrology and Hydraulic Systems, Third Edition (ISBN 9781577664550).<p> The goal of the first edition of <i>Physical Hydrology</i> was to provide a comprehensive text for upper-level undergraduates and graduate students that treats hydrology as a distinct geoscience. It attempted to develop an understanding of the conceptual basis of hydrology and an introduction to the quantitative relations that implement that understanding in answering scientific and water-resources-management questions. The text seemed to fulfill a need, and I have been pleased with its reception by my colleagues and students. </p> <p> My primary goals in revising <i>Physical Hydrology</i> have been to incorporate significant advances in the rapidly developing field of hydrologic science, to provide a more explicit connection of that science to hydrologic modeling, and to make more complete and useful the treatment of the relation between scientific hydrology and water-resources management. The major changes that have resulted are the following: </p> <ul> <li>Chapter 2 (Basic Hydrologic Concepts) now concludes with an introduction to hydrologic modeling, including discussions of model use, modeling terminology, and the process of model development. It also introduces the BROOK90 model, a physically based, lumped-parameter model that can be readily accessed on the World-Wide Web for student use. Discussions of the ways in which BROOK90 incorporates the physical relations discussed in the text are included as boxes in many of the subsequent chapters.</li> <li>Chapter 3 (Global Climate, Hydrologic Cycle, Soils, and Vegetation) now includes a tabulation of documented trends in global change of climatic and hydrologic quantities.</li> <li>In Chapter 4 (Precipitation), I have added a more extensive discussion of precipitation recycling and a new section on methods for handling missing data&#x2014;an almost universal problem in hydrologic analysis. Also, the discussion of methods for estimating areal precipitation has been streamlined somewhat (one of the few places in which I was able to cut!).</li> <li>In Chapter 5 (Snow and Snowmelt), I have updated the discussion of ways of estimating energy-balance components and added a discussion of hybrid snowmelt models that combine energy-balance and temperature-index approaches.</li> <li>Chapter 6 (Water in Soils) now introduces the concepts of soil-moisture diffusivity and sorptivity, adds a discussion of equilibrium soil-moisture profiles, and expands the discussion of moisture redistribution.</li> <li>Chapter 7 (Evapotranspiration) now contains a brief discussion of soil evaporation as well as updates of the treatments of lake evaporation and energy-budget estimation.</li> <li>In Chapter 8 (Ground Water), the discussion of ground&#x2014;water-surface-water relations has been expanded to include hyporheic flow and the Dupuit approximation for unconfined aquifers draining to streams.</li> <li>Chapter 9 (Stream Response to Water Input) has been reorganized so that the discussion of the mechanisms of stream response to water-input events now precedes the sections on rainfall-runoff modeling. The treatments of both mechanisms and modeling have been substantially revised and updated, and much of the detailed discussion of open-channel flow has been moved to Appendix B.</li> <li>Chapter 10 (Hydrology and Water Resources) has been entirely rewritten and expanded. It now includes a more complete and modern treatment of water-resource management goals and processes; a more detailed discussion of water supply and demand, including the concept of "safe yield" in various ground-water and surface-water settings and an expanded discussion of the estimation and application of flow-duration curves; a more complete discussion of water-quality issues; an expanded section on floods, including flood-frequency analysis; a completely new section on drought and low-flow analysis; and a concluding section on current and projected United States and global water use.</li> <li>Appendix A (Hydrologic Quantities) has been reorganized and largely rewritten to provide a more logical presentation of dimensions, units, and significant figures.</li> <li>Appendix B (Water as a Substance) now contains the detailed treatment of open-channel flow that was formerly in Chapter 9.</li> <li>Appendix C (Statistics) now includes discussions of approaches to fitting probability distributions to data and estimating parameters of distributions, which incorporate the application of L-moments, and a section on statistical criteria for calibrating and validating models.</li> <li>In Appendix D (Water and Energy in the Atmosphere), the treatment of turbulent transfer has been substantially revised.</li> <li>In Appendix F (Stream Gaging), the section on slope-area estimation of discharge has been completely revised.</li> <li>Appendix G is new. It contains links to hydrologic information on the World-Wide Web and is found on the CD accompanying the text.</li> </ul> <p> In keeping with my goal of treating hydrology as a science and of providing an entree to the literature of the field, this edition continues the practice of supporting its discussion with extensive reference citations, in the style of a journal article rather than that of most textbooks. In the revision, over 200 reference citations have been added, and they now total over 800. </p> <p> In carrying out the primary goals of the revision, I also saw opportunities to improve several other aspects of the text: </p> <ul> <li>Cross referencing is facilitated by use of a decimal numbering system for headings.</li> <li>Many of the exercises have been revised so that they provide more opportunity for student exploration of topics rather than simple "plug-and-chug" work.</li> <li>The spreadsheets on the CD that accompanies the book are now in EXCEL, and their formats have been improved and regularized. More modern units are used (kPa instead of mb; J and W instead of cal).</li> <li>The notation, especially for statistical quantities, is generally more conventional (and, I hope, less cumbersome).</li> <li>The "." symbol for multiplication is used throughout; this allows the use of multi-letter symbols without ambiguity.</li> </ul></p><h2>The First Industrial Revolution</h2><p>This book identifies the strategic changes in economic organisation, industrial structure and technological progress associated with the industrial revolution, which took place in Britain over the century 1750-1850 and which marked a watershed in world economic development - the beginnings of modern economic growth for developed countries and an example of spontaneous industrialisation for third world countries. The book assesses both starting point and achievement, analyses the substance of economic transformation and evaluates the role of government policy and institutional change in retarding or accelerating economic development. The second edition updates and expands the first by taking into account (and giving bibliographical references for) major topical knowledge and ideas. This work has proved a successful textbook for sixth form students as well as undergraduate students in faculties of economics, history, geography or social science generally. It is, however, sufficiently nontechnical to be intelligible to a general reader interested in putting problems of economic development into historical perspective.</p><p>This book identifies the strategic changes in economic organisation, industrial structure and technological progress associated with the industrial revolution in Britain from 1750-1850.

Cartes de visite, similar in format to calling cards, were relatively inexpensive collectibles that quickly became a new mode of mass communication. Despite being illiterate, Truth copyrighted her photographs in her name and added the caption &#x201c;I Sell the Shadow to Support the Substance. Sojourner Truth.&#x201d;<br><br> Featuring the largest collection of Truth&#x2019;s photographs ever published,&nbsp;<i>Enduring Truths</i>&nbsp;is the first book to explore how she used her image, the press, the postal service, and copyright laws to support her activism and herself. Darcy Grimaldo Grigsby establishes a range of important contexts for Truth&#x2019;s portraits, including the strategic role of photography and copyright for an illiterate former slave; the shared politics of Truth&#x2019;s cartes de visite and federal banknotes, which were both created to fund the Union cause; and the ways that photochemical limitations complicated the portrayal of different skin tones.

In his defense, some have alleged that the pope was doing a great deal to help the Jews but that his efforts were necessarily behind the scenes. This meticulously researched and balanced book examines exactly what the pope, his advisers, and his assistants at the Vatican Secretariat of State did to help the Jews of Italy. It finds that they did very little.<br><br>The book begins by discussing prewar Vatican and Jesuit publications, in which Zuccotti uncovers a hitherto unsuspected prevalence of anti-Jewish sentiment. These publications, along with archival documents, indicate that Vatican protests against Italian anti-Jewish laws were limited to measures affecting converts and Jews in mixed marriages with Catholics, as was help with emigration; the papal nuncio&#x2019;s visits to foreign Jews in Italian internment camps did not differ from those to non-Jews and in no way eased their material discomfort; and interventions by diplomats of the Holy See for Jews threatened with deportation were rare, always polite, and seldom decisive. <br><br>Above all, Zuccotti finds no evidence of a papal directive to church institutions to shelter Jews and much evidence to suggest that the pope remained uninvolved. The notion that Pius XII was benevolent and helpful to Jews behind the scenes proves to be a myth.</p><p><i>Under His Very Windows: The Vatican and the Holocaust in Italy</i> describes what the Vatican did--or did not do--to help Jews in Italy in World War II. Author Susan Zuccotti, who has written two other books about the Holocaust, demonstrates that little help of any kind came from Popes Pius XI and XII or their senior officials. She finds that the most significant gestures of help offered by the Church to Jews in Italy were made by clerics and believers--mostly nuns, monks, and priests--uninvolved in top-level Vatican discussions. By 1942, the pope "knew and believed a great deal about the exterminations." In 1943, when Germans took control of northern and central Italy and attempted to exterminate the region's Jewish population, the Vatican knew very clearly the magnitude of the genocide. The Vatican's silence, Zuccotti argues, still resonates in the Church's statements about the Holocaust today. <blockquote>The Church has not yet completed the process of dealing honestly with its history during the Holocaust. It has not yet made clear whether popes and high Vatican officials are to be included among its sons and daughters in every age who sometimes committed regrettable errors.</blockquote> Zuccotti's research ranges wide, from the anti-Jewish tone of Jesuit publications in the years leading up to World War II to contemporary interviews with Holocaust survivors. Her book is a significant addition to a chapter of Christian history that the Church has still to reckon with. <i>--Michael Joseph Gross</i>Winner of the 2000 National Jewish Book Award in the Jewish-Christian Relations category <br>Winner of The 2002 Sybil Halpern Milton Memorial Prize awarded by the German Studies Association</p><h2>Quantum Theory of Solids</h2><p>A modern presentation of theoretical solid state physics that builds directly upon Kittel&#39;s Introduction to Solid State Physics.

To demystify the process of calculating data, <em>Simple Statistics: Applications in Social Research</em> provides a concise introduction to basic social statistics. <br><br>In this innovative text, authors Terance D. Miethe and Jane Florence Gauthier illustrate how verbal statements and other types of material are converted into statistical codes, measures, and variables. To give students a sense of the "big picture," they clearly explain the relationship between research and statistics. Moreover, they focus on essential techniques rather than attempting to provide an intimidating, encyclopedic sweep of statistical procedures. <br><br>Written in a conversational tone, this invaluable resource does not talk down to students; instead, the authors clearly demonstrate the value of statistical thinking and reasoning in specific contexts. While most statistics texts focus primarily on <em>how to do</em> statistical procedures, they neglect to explain <em>why we do</em> them. This unique book covers both the <em>how</em> and <em>why</em> of statistics, preparing students to be better-informed, conscientious researchers. At the end of each chapter, a set of problems provides a rich context for social inquiry, challenging students to directly apply--and think critically--about what they've learned. <br><br>Throughout, the authors use hand computation methods to demonstrate how to apply various statistical procedures, and each procedure is illustrated by several helpful examples. In addition, each book is packaged with a user-friendly CD-ROM, which provides a step-by-step guide to using SPSS to perform the analyses described in the text. Detailed summaries, lists of key terms, and major formulas are included at the end of each chapter, and a comprehensive <em>Instructor's Manual</em> is also available. <br><br>A lively introduction to a complex subject, <em>Simple Statistics</em> is a vital resource for understanding the fascinating world of social statistics.<br></p><p><br><strong>Terance D. Miethe</strong> is Professor of Criminal Justice at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. He is author of <em>Simple Statistics: Applications in Criminology and Criminal Justice</em> (OUP, 2006) and coauthor of many books, including <em>Crime Profiles: The Anatomy of Dangerous Persons, Places, and Situations</em> (OUP, 2005). <br><br><strong>Jane Florence Gauthier</strong> is Assistant Professor of Criminal Justice at the University of Nevada, Las Vegas. Her current research interests focus on gender differences in criminal offending and issues surrounding community structure and crime.<br><br>"The authors' approach, tone, and structure are nearly flawless. They use excellent and thought-provoking examples, and a good distribution of sample problems. Students need to do the basic hand calculations in order to master the substantive meaning of statistical results, and this text puts them into that task. I would definitely adopt this text."--Richard Fancy, <em>Wayne State University</em><p></p><br>"What makes <em>Simple Statistics</em> distinctive is its remarkable balance between extremely technical statistics texts that are not written in a student-friendly fashion and oversimplified texts. Miethe writes in an exceptionally readable style, challenging students without intimidating them. Another key strength is the book's use of actual crime data, demonstrating the real-world applications of major statistical concepts."--Kent Kerley, <em>University of Alabama at Birmingham</em><p></p><br>"Throughout this book, the author explains the relevance of statistical techniques--not just the mechanics. The conversational style is engaging, encouraging students to keep reading and realize that they can master statistics. The book distinguishes itself from other texts by paring down what students are expected to learn."--Wayne J. Pitts, <em>University of Memphis</em><p></p><br></p><h2>The Sacred Paths of the East (3rd Edition)</h2><p><p> <b> </b> This book combines study of the dynamic historical development of each religious tradition with a comparative thematic structure.

It looks at each religion as an historically unique system, and explores the meaning of religious experience by focusing on major themes and issues comparatively. The book contains two main parts: Religions arising from India (Hinduism, Buddhism, Jainism. and Sikhism), and the religions from China and Japan (Confucianism, Daoism [Taoism], Shinto, and Mahayana Buddhism).This unique book allows readers to examine each of the world's major religions as a unique system of meaning, and at the same time, it lets them explore the inner nature of sacred experience by comparing basic themes and issues common to all religions and pertinent to their own personal lives. It begins with a discussion of the basic human questions and concerns relating to religion&#x2014;e.g., origin and identity, ultimate reality, human nature, and the good life&#x2014;and then uses these essential concepts to help describe the beliefs, practices, and historical development of each religion. Chapter topics include religions arising from India, and the religions of China and Japan. Also covered are basic gender issues; and the role of women in major world religions.

A key chapter of the book is devoted to Astaire&#x2019;s somewhat unwilling partnership with Ginger Rogers, the woman with whom he danced most dazzlingly.

Miami is the de facto capital of Latin America; it is a city where immigrants dominate, Spanish is ubiquitous, and Denny's is an ethnic restaurant. Are Miami's immigrants representative of a trend that is undermining American culture and identity? <br><br>Drawing from in-depth fieldwork in the city and looking closely at recent events such as the Eli�n Gonz�lez case, <i>This Land Is Our Land </i>examines interactions between immigrants and established Americans in Miami to address fundamental questions of American identity and multiculturalism. Rather than focusing on questions of assimilation, as many other studies have, this book concentrates on interethnic relations to provide an entirely new perspective on the changes wrought by immigration in the United States. A balanced analysis of Miami's evolution over the last forty years, <i>This Land Is Our Land </i>is also a powerful demonstration that immigration in America is not simply an "us versus them" phenomenon.</p><p>"This well-written and compelling story of immigrant resident relations in Miami will be read and enjoyed by lay people and scholars, and will no doubt produce stimulating discussions in classrooms throughout urban America."&#x2015;Jacqueline Hagan, author of <i>Deciding to Be Legal: A Maya Community in Houston</i><br><br>"Stepick and his colleagues provide a richly-textured and highly-nuanced account of how immigrants are remaking Miami&#x2015;a city that, in one generation, has been transformed by the influx of Latin American and Caribbean newcomers.

Every thought, feeling and action brought about by man does not only affect the world around him but will reappear in the future.&#x201d;</i> (from the preface)<i>&nbsp;</i></p><p>This course of lectures was originally offered as private, strictly verbal instruction to a selected group of esoteric students. In an atmosphere of earnest study, Rudolf Steiner &#x201c;translated&#x201d;important concepts of human and cosmic knowledgefrom the &#x201c;akashic script&#x201d; into earthly language&#x2015;content rarely found in his later lectures. Although Steiner was working within the Theosophical Society at the time, he nonetheless acted as an independent spiritual teacher: &#x201c;I would present only the results of what I observed in my own spiritual research.&#x201d;</p><p>The manifold, exact, and detailed descriptions of evolutionary events in these lectures form a background to the development of the humankind. Steiner vividly describes the great event of the Moon separating from the Earth, which occurred, according him, to provide an environment suited to human progress. The wonderful moment when the higher human being descended in a &#x201c;bell-like&#x201d; form and enveloped the lower human body&#x2015;then still on the level of animals&#x2015;depicts what eventually provided human beings with a body suited to the development of the true human self, or &#x201c;I.&#x201d; Spiritual beings and the great initiates then guided humanity along the destined path. </p>Rudolf Steiner presents a sweep of esoteric knowledge, including the phases of &#x201c;planetary&#x201d; evolution, myths and symbols, human physical and spiritual organs, illness, reincarnation, and more. Also included are unexpected insights into specific phenomena such as dinosaurs, bacteria, radiation, black and white magic, the Sphinx, and Freemasonry.</p><p><b>Rudolf Steiner</b>&nbsp;(1861&#x2013;1925) was born in the small village of Kraljevec, Austro-Hungarian Empire (now in Croatia), where he grew up (see right). As a young man, he lived in Weimar and Berlin, where he became a well-published scientific, literary, and philosophical scholar, known especially for his work with Goethe&#x2019;s scientific writings. At the beginning of the twentieth century, he began to develop his early philosophical principles into an approach to systematic research into psychological and spiritual phenomena. Formally beginning his spiritual teaching career under the auspices of the Theosophical Society, Steiner came to use the term Anthroposophy (and spiritual science) for his philosophy, spiritual research, and findings. The influence of Steiner&#x2019;s multifaceted genius has led to innovative and holistic approaches in medicine, various therapies, philosophy, religious renewal, Waldorf education, education for special needs, threefold economics, biodynamic agriculture, Goethean science, architecture, and the arts of drama, speech, and eurythmy. In 1924, Rudolf Steiner founded the General Anthroposophical Society, which today has branches throughout the world. He died in Dornach, Switzerland.</p><h2>Reading the Enemy&#39;s Mind: Inside Star Gate: America&#39;s Psychic Espionage Program</h2><p>From behind the cloak of US military secrecy comes the story of Star Gate, the project that for nearly a quarter of a century trained soldiers and civilian spies in extra-sensory perception �(ESP). Their objective: �To uncover the secrets of America&#x2019;s enemies using a skill called &#x201c;remote viewing.&#x201d; Assigned to the remote viewing unit in 1983 at a pivotal time in its history, Army Major Paul H. Smith served there for the rest of the decade, witnessing and taking part in many of the seminal national-security crises of the twentieth century.<br>Now for the first time since the Star Gate secrets have been declassified and the program mothballed by the CIA, the complete story can now be told of the every-day soldiers who were drafted onto this battlefield of human consciousness. From the program's victories such as finding hostages in Lebanon to tracking foreign testing of weapons of mass destruction to unrelenting attempts from within and without to destroy the program, the history of the Star Gate program is extraordinary. This is a story for the believer and the skeptic---a rare look at the innards of a top secret program and an eye-opening treatise on the power of the human mind to transcend the limitations of space and time. <br></p><p>When word got out in 1995 that the U.S. Defense Department and CIA had funded efforts to read people's minds, the news understandably excited all sorts of derision and conspiracy theories. Who would imagine that the story behind the efforts is actually a fascinating tale about the possibilities of human potential? Paul H. Smith tells the story of the U.S. "psychic spying" program in his book <i>Reading the Enemy's Mind</i>. Smith doesn't come across as some flaky new-ager. He was a young U.S. Army intelligence officer and Arab linguist who had no previous interest in extra-sensory perception when he was recruited into the program code-named "Star Gate" in 1983. Over the next seven years, he became one of the army's premier "remote viewers" and the primary author of its training manual on the subject. He also served as a tactical intelligence officer in the 101st Airborne Division in Operation Desert Storm/Shield and got a Master's degree from the Defense Intelligence College.<p> In <i>Reading the Enemy's Mind</i>, Smith reveals that the military and intelligence communities performed hundreds of experiments and operational intelligence assignments using "remote viewing," the government's term for ESP. The program's first big success came in 1979 when a viewer found a downed Soviet bomber in Africa after other intelligence operatives had failed--a coup praised by President Jimmy Carter. The psychics received target assignments from virtually every U.S. national-security agency, and Smith says they produced numerous positive results. Smith's biggest revelation, however, is that the government research found that almost all people--not merely a gifted few--seem to have the potential of developing ESP skills, with enough practice and a few tips from a pro like Smith. Many readers will no doubt find it hard to know what to make of <i>Reading the Enemy's Mind</i> and whether to believe any of it, but Smith writes with both color and a measured tone that together produce a captivating yarn even for the non-believers out there. <i>--Alex Roslin</i></p>Paul H. Smith, a retired Army intelligence officer and Operation Desert Storm veteran, spent seven years in the Department of Defense&#39;s remote-viewing program, serving as operational remote viewer, theory instructor and trainer, security officer, and unit historian. Smith has a B.A. in Middle Eastern studies from Brigham Young University, and an M.S. in Strategic Intelligence (Middle East emphasis) from the Defense Intelligence College, and is a doctoral candidate in philosophy at the University of Texas at Austin.

Considering both the paradoxes and the possibilities of postwar America, William H. Chafe portrays the significant cultural and political themes that have colored our country's past and present, including issues of race, class, gender, foreign policy, and economic and social reform. He examines such subjects as the Vietnam War, the civil rights movement, the origins and the end of the Cold War, the culture of the 1970s, the rise of the New Right, the events of September 11th and their aftermath, and various presidencies.<br><br>Now thoroughly revised and updated, the seventh edition of <em>The Unfinished Journey </em>combines and reorganizes several chapters. The former Chapter 14, "New Rules, Old Realities," is now divided into two chapters. The new Chapter 14, "An Era of Political Malaise," covers the political history of the 1970s. It is followed by Chapter 15, "A Divided Culture, A Divided Society," which assesses the shifting cultural landscape of the 1970s and the emergence of major fissures in the social system of the nation. The final chapter contains substantial new material on the administration of George W. Bush, the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, the election of 2008, and the first year of Barack Obama's presidency. Brilliantly written by a prize-winning historian, <em>The Unfinished Journey</em>, Seventh Edition, is an essential text for all students of recent American history.</p><p><br><strong>William H.

He is the author or coeditor of several books, including <em>Remembering Jim Crow: African Americans Tell About Life in the Segregated South</em> (2008), <em>The Rise and Fall of the American Century: The United States from 1890-2009</em> <em></em>(OUP, 2007), <em>A History of Our Time: Readings on Postwar America</em>, Seventh Edition (OUP, 2007), <em>Private Lives/Public Consequences: Personality and Politics in Modern America</em> (2005), and <em>Never Stop Running: Allard K. Lowenstein and the Struggle to Save American Liberalism</em> (1998). He is a former president of the Organization of American Historians and his books have been recognized with the Robert F. Kennedy Book Award (1981), the Sidney Hillman Book Award (1994), and the Lillian Smith Book Award (2003).<br>From 1941 to 1984, the United States achieved an amazing record of economic growth while witnessing the decline of its diplomacy and the fragmenting of its society. Author Chafe recounts the period in an exceptionally well-written study that bristles with telling anecdotes and quotations. His interpretation of events prior to 1968 is fairly routine but is supported with a sparkling density of statistical detail. However, after that signal date, his writing becomes more impressionistic and fails to fully account for the emergence of the New Right. The shift of traditionally liberal Jewish voters and the disaffection of blue-collar workers away from the left requires further research. For informed laypersons as well as scholars and specialists.

Just these little smudges, these traces of light and shadow, these breaths in and out. They feel like mine.</p> <p>1995<br> Near Nuremberg</p> <p>Sieglinde is shuffling and turning the pieces of paper, releasing the scent of old typewriter ribbons and pencil sharpenings, rubber stamps and vinyl chairs, ink pads, carbon paper. There are shelves of destroyed documents, rooms of them, ripped apart in the last frantic days of the GDR and crammed into sacks. Some are simple to reconstruct, torn only in two or four, and you can read whole sentences, even paragraphs &#x2013; but others are in pieces no bigger than postage stamps and bear mere fragments of words. There is no telling what will emerge from the sacks; no way of predicting whose life she will pull out in tatters. One day it's a university student who told a joke about Honecker; the next it's a housewife whose parcels sent from friends in the West betrayed clear capitalist leanings: aluminium foil, instant pudding. There's a train driver who refused to let a camera be pointed from his apartment towards his neighbour's, and so was monitored for years himself. A mother who let her son grow his hair long and wear jeans to school. A teenager who covered her bedroom walls with pictures of Michael Jackson. The intercepted letters are the easiest to put back together, the phrases well-worn, expected: I miss you. I love you. I wish I could see you. Sieglinde spends a week reconstructing a drawing of someone's apartment &#x2013; it's a detailed floor plan, viewed as if from above, as if the roof has been cut away to let you see into every room at once. It shows all the furniture down to the last footstool, and all the electrical fittings, and the measurements of every wall. There is even a newspaper on a coffee table and a cat asleep on an armchair; everything is there but the people. She finds photographs in the sacks, too: Polaroids of rumpled sheets, books in a bookcase, dishes left to soak in a kitchen sink &#x2013; a record of the ordinary, so that after a search it could all be put back in the right place and nobody would notice a thing. Sometimes she pauses over these small domestic scenes, tracing with a finger the crinkles in lace curtains tied into bunches, the eddy of an unmade bed.</p> <p>She has developed her own system, as all the puzzlers have. She lifts the scraps from the bags as gently as possible to preserve the original strata, sorting them according to size, paper colour, texture, weight, as well as typeface or handwriting, before fitting ragged edge to ragged edge to restore the destroyed file. It can take days to complete a single page, and always there are pieces she cannot home, holes she cannot fill. Sixteen thousand sacks, six hundred million scraps of paper &#x2013; it will take centuries to finish &#x2013; but she trains herself to focus only on the snippets in front of her, to find the patterns, the matches. She knows she is running out of time; soon she will retire, and she will return to her old life in Berlin, give notice to the student who is subletting her apartment. She pushes herself to work as quickly as possible, restoring the stories of ordinary people, watching the puzzles decipher themselves beneath her hands. And always, in the back of her mind, the puzzle that has never left her: Erich Kr�ning. She searches for him in every file, her heart turning over when she thinks she sees his name &#x2013; though it is never the right Erich, never her Erich; of course not. I'm not telling that sort of story; I can't put everything back together.</p> <p>But I am getting ahead of myself.</p><br> <p><b>STRENGTH THROUGH JOY</b></p><br> <p>I don't know whether the little bones,<br> Rinsed by the sea, will tangle together,<br> Or whether, wrapped in clouds,<br> They will reach for music and</p> <p>I know that without fragrance,<br> Like fingers stiff in the joints,<br> Offer no magic<br> For which the living call in sleep.</p><br> <p>July 1939<br> Near Leipzig</p> <p>The Kr�nings rose earlier than usual, though everything was already in order: the pathways were swept, flowers cut and arranged, windows polished until the glass all but disappeared. In the fields the wheat grew straight and golden and in the orchard the bees were waking in their hives. The living-room curtains shifted a little of their own accord &#x2013; was a window loose? Was there a draught? Emilie and her husband Christoph sat in each chair in turn and pretended to be guests, looking at their home through outside eyes. The sun was not yet up, the rooster only just beginning to crow, but they suspected it would be a stifling day. It was sensible to be prepared for the visit, to allow themselves time to check that nothing was out of place. Perhaps they had not noticed that the fringe of a carpet was tangled, or that the blessing hung askew; perhaps a clock needed winding or a cushion punching back into shape &#x2013; but no, all was correct: flowers in the vases, wheat in the fields, bees in the hives and Mein Kampf on the shelf.</p> <p>When they were satisfied with the house, the Kr�nings began to prepare themselves. Emilie sat at her mirror and parted and braided her pale blond hair, pinning it into place so it would not move. She could feel her scalp and the fine skin at her temples pulling, but the sensation was quite bearable. She was proud of her hair; it hung to the small of her back when she brushed it out, and the strands of her braids were as thick as thumbs.</p> <p>'I'll give you my skin if you give me your hair,' her sister Uschi used to say when they shared a bedroom.</p> <p>'I'll give you my eyes if you give me your ankles,' Emilie would reply.</p> <p>She pinched a little blood into her cheeks now and smoothed her church dress over her slim hips. You really could not tell she was a mother. 'Thank you for coming,' she said to her reflection. 'Thank you for considering our case.' You-you, you, the turtle dove called from the forest. You-you, you. The sound drifted to Emilie's window and seemed to float there in the indistinct early morning. The day had not yet decided what it would become.</p> <p>She watched Christoph splash his razor in the water. He paused to wipe steam from the mirror &#x2013; he kept disappearing &#x2013; and then he held taut the skin of his throat. He was a tall, sinewy man; he had to crouch to see himself. He frowned away a lock of sandy hair that fell forward into his eyes, giving Emilie a small smile when he noticed her looking at him. The sound of the blade against his flesh called to Emilie's mind the first rasp of fire burning off a spent crop. In a way she regretted those blazes &#x2013; a certain melancholy rose in her as she watched the remains of a harvest begin to crumple and vanish &#x2013; but unless you cleared away waste matter there could be no new growth, and any small sentiment always passed once the flames had burst and spread. Christoph smoothed his hair down with water, flattening the curls at his brow. The little scar above his eye was pale in the early light, almost invisible, though as summer wore on and his skin turned browner it would show itself more. His father had been teaching him how to use the scythe and Christoph had stepped too close. His mother still fussed over it: if it had been half a centimetre lower . . . Sometimes Emilie touched it with her long, cool fingers and said the same thing.</p> <p>At breakfast the Kr�nings sliced open their rolls and spread them with butter and jam while their wedding clock tutted at them from the far wall. Today the little woman had swung out from the clock's insides to tell them that rain was on the way, but it didn't feel like it. The oilcloth table-cover caught the pale light from the window to the north and lay cool beneath their wrists. They took measured bites, neither hurrying nor dawdling. The guest was not getting into Leipzig until after ten. There was plenty of time.</p> <p>'Is this the last of Uschi's jam?' said Christoph.</p> <p>'Of the cherry, yes,' said Emilie. 'There's one more apricot.'</p> <p>'The apricot is very good too,' said Christoph. 'Though I prefer the cherry.'</p></p><h2>Viruses: Biology, Applications, and Control</h2><p><p><em>Viruses: Biology, Application, and Control</em> is a concise textbook for advanced undergraduate and graduate students covering the essential aspects of virology included in biomedical science courses. It is an updated and expanded version of David Harper&#x2019;s <em>Molecular Virology</em>, Second Edition. Focusing on key mechanisms and developments, Viruses presents many new recent scientific advances, including virus evolution, emerging infections, virus extinction, control of infections, antiviral drugs, gene therapy, bacteriophage therapy, and diagnostics.</p> <p></p> <p>The first chapters introduce the reader to the structure and nature of viruses, including their classification and evolution. As viruses cause widespread and serious disease, the ensuing chapters explain how they interact with the immune system and the different ways we try to defeat them: vaccines, antiviral drugs, and immunotherapy. Laboratory methods for viral detection and laboratory diagnosis are also covered. While viruses do cause disease, many do not, and their special biology means they can have beneficial uses, and this aspect of viruses is emphasized. One of the most interesting areas in virology, given extensive coverage here, is how new viruses emerge and establish themselves.</p> <p></p> <p><em>Viruses: Biology, Application, and Control</em> is a rigorous treatment of the molecular side of virology and its conceptual approach makes it an essential text for students and non-specialists.</p></p><p><p>"...this is a recommended book for undergraduates studying virology and would provide a good source material for a lecture series on the topic." - <strong><em>Immunology News</em></strong></p></p><h2>Hidden Gospels: How the Search for Jesus Lost Its Way</h2><p>This incisive critique thoroughly and convincingly debunks the claims that recently discovered texts such as the Gospel of Thomas, the Gospel of Mary, and even the Dead Sea Scrolls undermine the historical validity of the New Testament.<br> Jenkins places the recent controversies surrounding the hidden gospels in a broad historical context and argues that, far from being revolutionary, such attempts to find an alternative Christianity date back at least to the Enlightenment. By employing the appropriate scholarly and historical methodologies, he demonstrates that the texts purported to represent pristine Christianity were in fact composed long after the canonical gospels found in the Bible. Produced by obscure heretical movements, these texts have attracted much media attention chiefly because they seem to support radical, feminist, and post-modern positions in the modern church. Indeed, Jenkins shows how best-selling books on the "hidden gospels" have been taken up by an uncritical, drama-hungry media as the basis for a social movement that could have powerful effects on the faith and practice of contemporary Christianity.<br></p><p><br><strong>Philip Jenkins</strong>, one of the world's leading religion scholars joined Baylor University's Institute for Studies of Religion as Distinguished Professor of History and Co-Director for the Program on Historical Studies of Religion.<br>In addition to attempting to find postmodern, multiple, nontraditional interpretations of traditional biblical texts, the renowned Jesus Seminar has published texts from outside the traditional canon, heralding them as new discoveries that suggest reinterpretation of traditional Christian theology and practice. In this book, Jenkins counters the interpretations of Jesus Seminar scholars, concisely and evenhandedly introducing their theories and presenting historical and textual evidence to contradict them. He questions their "discoveries" of texts that have been known to biblical scholars for at least two hundred years, challenges their dating of texts in order to impart them greater weight and traces many of their purportedly new interpretations to age-old traditions ("heresies" to the early Church) such as Gnosticism. He ascribes to the seminar scholars "inverted fundamentalism," claiming that these critics, ironically, assign great authority to historically questionable noncanonical texts, such as The Gospel of Thomas, while simultaneously challenging the authority and validity of the long-established canon. He attributes this bias to both a postmodern search for meaning and a lay audience hungry for religious truth, while noting that only new interpretations advance academic careers and attract media attention. In short, he argues that the Jesus Seminar offers nothing new under the sun. Jenkins closes out this forceful critique by noting "we can only hope" that when new biblical texts surface, they might be "evaluated on their merits, and not solely for their value in cultural battles." <p></p><p>Copyright 2001 Cahners Business Information, Inc.</p></p>
